# API Reference

The Swagger UI for the API is available at [/api/v1/openapi](https://app.documenso.com/api/v1/openapi). This page provides detailed information about the API endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Upload a Document

Uploading a document to your Documenso account requires a two-step process.

First, you need to make a POST request to the `/api/v1/documents` endpoint, which takes a JSON payload with the following fields:

- `title` - This represents the title of the document and it's a required field.
- `externalId` - This is an optional field that you can use to store an external identifier for the document. This can be useful for tracking the document in your own systems.
- `recipients` - This is an array of recipient objects and it's required. Each recipient object has the following fields:
  - `name` - The name of the recipient.
  - `email` - The email address of the recipient.
  - `role` - The role of the recipient. See the [available roles](/users/signing-documents#roles).
  - `signingOrder` - The order in which the recipient should sign the document. This is an integer value starting from 0.
- `meta` - This is an object that contains additional metadata for the document. It has the following fields:
  - `subject` - The subject of the email that will be sent to the recipients.
  - `message` - The message of the email that will be sent to the recipients.
  - `timezone` - The timezone in which the document should be signed.
  - `dateFormat` - The date format that should be used in the document.
  - `redirectUrl` - The URL to which the user should be redirected after signing the document.
  - `signingOrder` - The signing order for the document. This can be either `SEQUENTIAL` or `PARALLEL`.
- `authOptions` - This is an object that contains authentication options for the document. It has the following fields:
  - `globalAccessAuth` - The authentication level required to access the document. This can be either `ACCOUNT` or `null`.
    - If the document is set to `ACCOUNT`, all recipients must authenticate with their Documenso account to access the document.
    - If it's set to `null`, the document can be accessed without a Documenso account.
  - `globalActionAuth` - The authentication level required to perform actions on the document. This can be either `ACCOUNT`, `PASSKEY`, `TWO_FACTOR_AUTH`, or `null`.
    - If the document is set to `ACCOUNT`, all recipients must authenticate with their Documenso account to perform actions on the document.
    - If it's set to `PASSKEY`, all recipients must have the passkey active to perform actions on the document.
    - If it's set to `TWO_FACTOR_AUTH`, all recipients must have the two-factor authentication active to perform actions on the document.
    - If it's set to `null`, all the recipients can perform actions on the document without any authentication.
- `formValues` - This is an object that contains additional form values for the document. This property only works with native PDF fields and it only accepts three types: number, text and boolean.

Here's an example of the JSON payload for uploading a document:

```json
{
  "title": "my-document.pdf",
  "externalId": "12345",
  "recipients": [
    {
      "name": "Alex Blake",
      "email": "alexblake@email.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Ash Drew",
      "email": "ashdrew@email.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 0
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "subject": "Sign the document",
    "message": "Hey there, please sign this document.",
    "timezone": "Europe/London",
    "dateFormat": "Day, Month Year",
    "redirectUrl": "https://mysite.com/welcome",
    "signingOrder": "SEQUENTIAL"
  },
  "authOptions": {
    "globalAccessAuth": "ACCOUNT",
    "globalActionAuth": "PASSKEY"
  }
}
```

A successful API call to this endpoint will return a pre-signed S3 URL to which you can upload the document.

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "string",
  "documentId": 0,
  "externalId": "string",
  "recipients": [
    {
      "recipientId": 0,
      "name": "string",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "token": "string",
      "role": "CC",
      "signingOrder": 0,
      "signingUrl": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```
