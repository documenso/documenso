# API Reference

The Swagger UI for the API is available at [/api/v1/openapi](https://app.documenso.com/api/v1/openapi). This page provides detailed information about the API endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Upload a Document

Uploading a document to your Documenso account requires a two-step process.

First, you need to make a POST request to the `/api/v1/documents` endpoint, which takes a JSON payload with the following fields:

- `title` - This represents the title of the document and it's a required field.
- `externalId` - This is an optional field that you can use to store an external identifier for the document. This can be useful for tracking the document in your own systems.
- `recipients` - This is an array of recipient objects. Each recipient object has the following fields:
  - `name` - The name of the recipient.
  - `email` - The email address of the recipient.
  - `role` - The role of the recipient. See the [available roles](/users/signing-documents#roles).
  - `signingOrder` - The order in which the recipient should sign the document. This is an integer value starting from 0.

... continue the rest ...

Here's an example of the JSON payload for uploading a document:

```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "externalId": "string",
  "recipients": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "role": "SIGNER",
      "signingOrder": 0
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "subject": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "timezone": "Etc/UTC",
    "dateFormat": "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a",
    "redirectUrl": "string",
    "signingOrder": "PARALLEL"
  },
  "authOptions": {
    "globalAccessAuth": "ACCOUNT",
    "globalActionAuth": "ACCOUNT"
  },
  "formValues": {
    "additionalProp1": "string",
    "additionalProp2": "string",
    "additionalProp3": "string"
  }
}
```

A successful API call to this endpoint will return a pre-signed S3 URL to which you can upload the document.

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "string",
  "documentId": 0,
  "externalId": "string",
  "recipients": [
    {
      "recipientId": 0,
      "name": "string",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "token": "string",
      "role": "CC",
      "signingOrder": 0,
      "signingUrl": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```
