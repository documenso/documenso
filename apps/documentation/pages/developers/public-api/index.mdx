# Public API

Documenso provides a public REST API enabling you to interact with your documents programmatically. The API exposes various HTTP endpoints that allow you to perform operations such as:

- retrieving, uploading, deleting, and sending documents for signing
- creating, updating, and deleting recipients
- creating, updating, and deleting document fields

The documentation walks you through creating API keys and using them to authenticate your API requests. You'll also learn about the available endpoints, request and response formats, and how to use the API.

## API V1 - Stable

Check out the [API V1 documentation](https://app.documenso.com/api/v1/openapi) for details about the API endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication methods.

## API V2 - Beta

Our new API V2 is currently in Beta. The new API features typed SDKs for TypeScript, Python and Go and example code for many more.
