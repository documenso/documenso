# Public API

Documenso provides a public REST API enabling you to interact with your documents programmatically. The API exposes various HTTP endpoints that allow you to perform operations such as:

- retrieving, uploading, deleting, and sending documents for signing
- creating, updating, and deleting recipients
- creating, updating, and deleting document fields

The documentation walks you through creating API keys and using them to authenticate your API requests. You'll also learn about the available endpoints, request and response formats, and how to use the API.
