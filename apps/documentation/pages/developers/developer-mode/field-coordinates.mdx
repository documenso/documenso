## Field Coordinates

Field coordinates represent the position of a field in a document. They are returned in the `pageX` and `pageY` properties of the field.

To enable field coordinates, you can use the `devmode` query parameter.

```bash
https://app.documenso.com/documents/<document-id>/edit?devmode=true
```

You should then see the coordinates on top of each field.
