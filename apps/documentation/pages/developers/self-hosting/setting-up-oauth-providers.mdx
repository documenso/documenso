## Google OAuth (Gmail)

To use Google OAuth, you will need to create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Identity and Access Management (IAM) API. You will also need to create a new OAuth client ID and download the client secret.

### Create and configure a new OAuth client ID

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one
3. If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services
4. On the left, click Credentials
5. Click New Credentials, then select OAuth client ID
6. When prompted to select an application type, select Web application
7. Enter a name for your client ID, and click Create
8. Click the download button to download the client secret
9. Set the authorized javascript origins to `https://<documenso-domain>`
10. Set the authorized redirect URIs to `https://<documenso-domain>/api/auth/callback/google`
11. In the Documenso environment variables, set the following:

```
NEXT_PRIVATE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
NEXT_PRIVATE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
```

Finally verify the signing in with Google works by signing in with your Google account and checking the email address in your profile.
