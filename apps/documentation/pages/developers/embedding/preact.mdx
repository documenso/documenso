# Preact Integration

Our Preact SDK provides a simple way to embed a signing experience within your Preact application. It supports both direct link templates and signing tokens.

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @documenso/embed-preact
```

## Usage

To embed a signing experience, you'll need to provide the token for the document you want to embed. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on your use case.

### Direct Link Template

If you have a direct link template, you can simply provide the token for the template to the `EmbedDirectTemplate` component.

```jsx
import { EmbedDirectTemplate } from '@documenso/embed-preact';

const MyEmbeddingComponent = () => {
  const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'; // Replace with the actual token

  return <EmbedDirectTemplate token={token} />;
};
```

### Signing Token

```jsx
import { EmbedSignDocument } from '@documenso/embed-preact';

const MyEmbeddingComponent = () => {
  const token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'; // Replace with the actual token

  return <EmbedSignDocument token={token} />;
};
```

### Styling and Theming (Platform Plan)

Platform customers have access to advanced styling options:

```jsx
import { EmbedDirectTemplate } from '@documenso/embed-preact';

const MyEmbeddingComponent = () => {
  const token = 'your-token';
  const customCss = `
    .documenso-embed {
      border-radius: 8px;
      box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    }
  `;
  const cssVars = {
    primary: '#0000FF',
    background: '#F5F5F5',
    radius: '8px',
  };

  return (
    <EmbedDirectTemplate token={token} css={customCss} cssVars={cssVars} darkModeDisabled={true} />
  );
};
```
