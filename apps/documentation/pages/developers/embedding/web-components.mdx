# Web Components Integration

Our Web Components SDK provides a simple way to embed a signing experience within your framework-less web application. It supports both direct link templates and signing tokens.

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @documenso/embed-webcomponent
```

Then in your html file, add the following to add the script, replacing the path with the proper path to the web component script.

```html
<script src="YOUR_PATH_HERE"></script>
```

## Usage

To embed a signing experience, you'll need to provide the token for the document you want to embed. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on your use case.

### Direct Link Template

If you have a direct link template, you can simply provide the token for the template to the `documenso-embed-direct-template` tag.

```html
<documenso-embed-direct-template
  token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
</documenso-embed-direct-template>
```

### Creating via JavaScript

You can also create the tag element using javascript, for dynamic generation of either modes. For example, this would add the sign document embed to the DOM.

```javascript
document.getElementById('my-wrapper-here').innerHTML = '';

const tag = document.createElement('documenso-embed-sign-document');
tag.setAttribute('token', data.token);
tag.style.width = '100%';
tag.style.height = '100%';

document.getElementById('my-wrapper-here').appendChild(tag);
```
