# Team's Document Visibility

By default, all documents created in a team are visible to all team members. However, you can control the visibility of your documents by changing the document's visibility settings.

To set the visibility of a document, click on the **Document visibility** dropdown in the document's settings panel.

The document visibility can be set to one of the following options:

- **Everyone** - The document is visible to all team members.
- **Managers and above** - The document is visible to people with the role of Manager or above.
- **Admin only** - The document is only visible to the team's admins.
