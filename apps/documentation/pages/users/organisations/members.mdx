# Organisation Members

Organisation members are the core users of your organisation. They are the ones who can access the team resources and collaborate with other members.

## Organisation Roles

You can assign different permissions to organisation members by using roles. The roles available are:

|         Role         | Manage Settings/Teams/Members | Billing | Delete Organisation |
| :------------------: | :---------------------------: | :-----: | ------------------- |
|  Organisation Owner  |              ✅               |   ✅    | ✅                  |
|  Organisation Admin  |              ✅               |   ✅    | ✅                  |
| Organisation Manager |              ✅               |   ❌    | ❌                  |
| Organisation Member  |              ❌               |   ❌    | ❌                  |

<Callout type="info">
  Organisation admins and managers will automatically have access to all teams as the "Team Admin"
  role. When creating a team you can also decide whether to automatically allow normal members to
  access it by default as well.

## Adding Members to Your Organisation

There are two ways to add members to your organisation:

### Manual Invitation

To manually invite organisation members, you need to be an organisation owner, admin or manager.

1. Open the menu switcher top right
2. Hover over your new organisation and click the settings icon
3. Navigate to the "Members" tab
4. Click "Invite Member"

Once you click on the "Invite member" button, you will be prompted to enter the email address of the person you want to invite. You can also select the role of the person you are inviting.

You can also bulk-invite members by uploading a CSV file with the email addresses and roles of the people you want to invite.

The table below shows how the CSV file should be structured:

| Email address             | Role    |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| org-admin@documenso.com   | Admin   |
| org-manager@documenso.com | Manager |
| org-member@documenso.com  | Member  |

### Domain Auto-Assignment

Domain auto-assignment provides an automated way to add members to your organisation. When you configure specific email domains, users who sign up with matching email addresses will be automatically added to your organisation.

#### How Auto-Assignment Works

1. **Domain Configuration**: Organisation administrators configure approved domains (e.g., "yourcompany.com")
2. **User Registration**: A user signs up with a matching email address (e.g., "john@yourcompany.com")
3. **Email Verification**: The user completes the standard email verification process
4. **Automatic Membership**: The verified user is automatically added as an "Organisation Member"

<Callout type="info">
  Users added through domain auto-assignment are always assigned the "Member" role by default. You
  can change their role after they join if needed.
</Callout>

#### Benefits of Domain Auto-Assignment

- **Seamless Onboarding**: New employees are automatically included without manual intervention
- **Consistent Coverage**: Ensures all users with company email addresses are part of the organisation
- **Reduced Administration**: Eliminates the need to track and invite individual users
- **Immediate Access**: Auto-assigned users immediately receive organisation settings and branding

<Callout type="warning">
  Domain auto-assignment only works after email verification to ensure security. Only configure
  domains that your organisation legitimately controls.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The basic team plan includes 5 organisation members. Going over the 5 members will charge your
  organisation according to the seat plan pricing.
</Callout>

## Manage Organisation Members

On the same page, you can change the organisation member's roles or remove them from the organisation.

### Member Sources

Organisation members can be added through:

- **Manual Invitation**: Explicitly invited by administrators
- **Domain Auto-Assignment**: Automatically added based on email domain verification
- **Direct Addition**: Added directly by organisation administrators

You can identify how a member joined your organisation through the member management interface.
