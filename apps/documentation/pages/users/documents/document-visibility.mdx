# Document Visibility

The default document visibility option allows you to control who can view and access the documents uploaded within a team.

This value can either be set in the [document preferences](/users/documents/document-preferences), or when you [create the document](/users/documents/send-document)

## Document Visibility Options

The document visibility can be set to one of the following options:

- **Everyone** - The document is visible to all team members.
- **Managers and above** - The document is visible to team members with the role of _Manager or above_ and _Admin_.
- **Admin only** - The document is only visible to the team's admins.

The default document visibility is set to "_EVERYONE_" by default. You can change this setting by going to the [document preferences page](/users/documents/document-preferences) and selecting a different visibility option.

## How it works

- If a user with the "_Member_" role creates a document and the default document visibility is set to "_Everyone_", the document's visibility is set to "_EVERYONE_".
  - The user can't change the visibility of the document in the document editor.
- If a user with the "_Member_" role creates a document and the default document visibility is set to "_Admin_" or "_Managers and above_", the document's visibility is set to the default document visibility ("_Admin_" or "_Managers and above_" in this case).
  - The user can't change the visibility of the document in the document editor.
- If a user with the "_Manager_" role creates a document and the default document visibility is set to "_Everyone_" or "_Managers and above_", the document's visibility is set to the default document visibility ("_Everyone_" or "_Managers and above_" in this case).
  - The user can change the visibility of the document to any of these options, except "_Admin_", in the document editor.
- If a user with the "_Manager_" role creates a document and the default document visibility is set to "_Admin_", the document's visibility is set to "_Admin_".
  - The user can't change the visibility of the document in the document editor.
- If a user with the "_Admin_" role creates a document, and the default document visibility is set to "_Everyone_", "_Managers and above_", or "_Admin_", the document's visibility is set to the default document visibility.
  - The user can change the visibility of the document to any of these options in the document editor.

You can change the visibility of a document at any time by editing the document and selecting a different visibility option.

  Updating the default document visibility in the team's general preferences will not affect the
  visibility of existing documents. You will need to update the visibility of each document
  individually.

## A Note on Document Access

The `document owner` (the user who created the document) always has access to the document, regardless of the document's visibility settings. This means that even if a document is set to "Admins only", the document owner can still view and edit the document.

The `recipient` (the user who receives the document for signature, approval, etc.) also has access to the document, regardless of the document's visibility settings. This means that even if a document is set to "Admins only", the recipient can still view and sign the document.
