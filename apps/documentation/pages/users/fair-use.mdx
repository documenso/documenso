# Fair Use Policy

We like to overdeliver, but we cannot overcommit.

Our plans are designed to be generous and flexible without forcing customers into rigid volume limits they may never use. At the same time, estimating usage at scale is hard, especially over short periods. This fair use policy exists to keep plans sustainable while allowing us to add more value wherever possible without overformalizing restrictions.

We offer our plans without any limits on volume because we want users and customers to make the most of their accounts. Estimating volume is incredibly hard, especially for shorter intervals like a quarter. We are not interested in selling volume packages our customers end up not using.

This is why our plans not include a limit on signing or API volume. If you are a customer of these plans, we ask you to abide by this fair use policy.

### Spirit of the Plan

Use the limitless plans as much as you like. They are meant to offer a lot. Please respect the spirit and intended scope of the account.

  What happens if I go beyond the scope of this policy? We will ask you to upgrade to a fitting plan
  or custom pricing. We will not block your account without reaching out. You can message us for
  questions.

### Fair Support

We believe in fair support as much as fair usage.

Fair support includes reasonable and within reason application level help for self hosted users. We will help you get unstuck and point you in the right direction when issues come up. Support is provided in good faith and within reasonable time and effort limits. We are not your operations team and cannot take responsibility for running, monitoring, or maintaining your infrastructure.

If you are unsure whether something falls within fair use or fair support, reach out. We are happy to talk it through.

### DO

- Sign as many documents as you need with the individual plan for your single business or organization
- Use the API and automation tools to automate your signing workflows
- Experiment with plans and integrations while testing what you want to build

### DON'T

- Use an individual account API to power a platform or product
- Run a large company signing thousands of documents per day on a small team plan
- Expect enterprise level support for fair support plan
- Overthink this policy. If you are a paying customer, we want you to win
