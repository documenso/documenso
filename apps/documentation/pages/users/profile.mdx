# User Profile

Documenso allows you to create a public profile to share your templates for anyone to sign. This is useful for distributing and collecting signatures for commonly used documents, making it more efficient for both the document creator and the signers.

<Callout type="info">A free Documenso account gives you 5 free signatures per month.</Callout>

<Steps>

### Navigate to Your Profile Settings

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "User settings". Then, navigate to the "Public Profile" tab to configure your profile.

### (Mandatory) Set Your Profile URL

This is the URL that people will use to access your profile. We recommend choosing something easy to remember and share.

The structure of the URL is as follows:

```bash
https://app.documenso.com/p/<username>
```

Setting the public profile URL is mandatory to publish your profile.

### (Optional) Add a Bio Description

If you want to add a description to your profile, you can do so here. This is a good place to introduce yourself and explain what kind of documents you have available for signing.

### (Optional) Add a Profile Picture

Uploading a profile picture is optional, but we recommend it to make your profile more recognizable.

### Private/Public Profile

You can choose to make your profile public or private. Only you can access it if you make it private. If you make it public, anyone with the link can access it.

To make your profile public, toggle the switch to the right ("Show") at the top right-hand side of the page.

### (Optional) Link Templates

Linking templates to your profile is optional, but it's what makes your profile helpful. Linking templates allow people to sign documents directly from your profile. As a result, we recommend linking at least one template you want to share with others.

Learn more about [templates](/users/templates).

### Publish your Profile

After configuring your profile, click the "Update" button at the bottom of the page to publish it. Once you have published your profile, you can share the link with others if you made it public.
