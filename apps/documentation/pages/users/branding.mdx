# Branding Preferences

Branding preferences allow you to set the default settings when emailing documents to your recipients.

## Preferences

Branding preferences can be set on either the organisation or team level.

By default, teams inherit the preferences from the organisation. You can override these preferences on the team level at any time.

To access the preferences, navigate to either the organisation or teams settings page and click the **Branding** tab under the **Preferences** section.

On this page, you can:

- **Upload a Logo** - Upload your team's logo to be displayed instead of the default Documenso logo.
- **Set the Brand Website** - Enter the URL of your team's website to be displayed in the email communications sent by the team.
- **Add Additional Brand Details** - You can add additional information to display at the bottom of the emails sent by the team. This can include contact information, social media links, and other relevant details.
