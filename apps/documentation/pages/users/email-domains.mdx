# Email Domains

Email Domains allow you to send emails to recipients from your own domain instead of the default Documenso email address.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Platform and Enterprise Only**: Email Domains is only available to Platform and Enterprise
  customers.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Email Domains, ensure you have:

- A Platform or Enterprise subscription
- Access to your domain's DNS settings
- Access to your Documenso organisation as a manager or admin

<Steps>

### Access Email Domains Settings

Navigate to your Organisation settings and locate the Email Domains section

![Email Domains settings page](/email-domains/email-domains-settings-page.webp)

### Add a New Domain

Click on the "Add Email Domain" to begin the setup process.

### Configure DNS Records

After adding your domain, Documenso will provide you with the following required DNS records that need to be configured on your domain:

- **SPF Record**: Specifies which servers are authorized to send emails from your domain
- **DKIM Record**: Provides email authentication and prevents tampering

<Callout type="info">
  If you already have a SPF record configured, you will need to update it to include Amazon SES as
  an authorised server instead of creating a new record.
</Callout>

Configure these records in your domain's DNS settings according to their specific instructions.

### Verify Domain Configuration

Once you've added the DNS records, return to the Documenso Email Domains settings and click the "Verify" button.
Documenso will check if the DNS records are properly configured. If successful, the domain will be marked as "Active".

  Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate.
</Callout>

## Domain Management

### Multiple Domains

You can configure multiple email domains for different purposes:

- **Primary domain**: For general document sending
- **Regional domains**: For different geographic regions
- **Department domains**: For specific departments or teams

### Domain Status

Each domain will have a status indicator:

- **Active**: Domain is verified and ready to send emails
- **Pending**: DNS records are being verified
- **Failed**: DNS verification failed, requires attention
- **Suspended**: Domain has been temporarily suspended

### Domain Settings

For each domain, you can configure:

- **From name**: The display name that appears in the "From" field
- **Reply-to address**: Where replies should be directed
- **Bounce handling**: How to handle bounced emails
- **Spam filtering**: Advanced spam protection settings

## Emails

Todo:

1. Manage domain
2. Add email
3. Configure it as default email in Email settings

## Troubleshooting
