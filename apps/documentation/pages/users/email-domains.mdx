# Email Domains

Email Domains allow you to send emails to recipients from your own domain instead of the default Documenso email address.

<Callout type="info">
  **Platform and Enterprise Only**: Email Domains is only available to Platform and Enterprise
  customers.
</Callout>

## Creating Email Domains

Before setting up email domains, ensure you have:

- A Platform or Enterprise subscription
- Access to your domain's DNS settings
- Access to your Documenso organisation as an admin or manager

<Steps>

### Access Email Domains Settings

Navigate to your Organisation email domains settings page and click the "Add Email Domain" button.

### Configure DNS Records

After adding your domain, Documenso will provide you with the following required DNS records that need to be configured on your domain:

- **SPF Record**: Specifies which servers are authorized to send emails from your domain
- **DKIM Record**: Provides email authentication and prevents tampering

<Callout type="info">
  If you already have an SPF record configured, you will need to update it to include Amazon SES as
  an authorized server instead of creating a new record.
</Callout>

Configure these records in your domain's DNS settings according to their specific instructions.

### Verify Domain Configuration

Once you've added the DNS records, return to the Documenso email domains settings page and click the "Verify" button.
This will trigger a verification process which will check if the DNS records are properly configured. If successful, the domain will be marked as "Active".

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for the DNS records to propagate.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Creating Emails

Once your email domain has been configured, you can create multiple email addresses which your members can use when sending documents to recipients.

<Steps>

### Select the Email Domain You Want to Use

Navigate to the email domains settings page and click "Manage" on the domain you want to use.

### Add a New Email

Click on the "Add Email" button to begin the setup process.

![Create email](/email-domains/email-domains-manage-create-email.webp)

### Use Email

Once you have added an email, you can configure it to be the default email on either the:

- Organisation email preferences page
- Team email preferences page

When a draft document is created, it will inherit the email configured on the team if set, otherwise it will inherit the email configured in the organisation.

You can also configure the email address directly on the document to override the default email if required.

</Steps>

## Notes

- If you change the default email, it will not retroactively update any existing documents with the old default email.
- If the email domain becomes invalid, all emails using that domain will fail to send.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**DNS Verification Fails**

- Double-check all DNS record values
- Ensure records are added to the correct domain
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

**Emails Not Delivering**

- Check domain reputation and blacklist status
- Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Review bounce and spam reports
