# Global Settings

You can manage your team's global settings by clicking on the **Global Settings** tab in the team's settings dashboard.

The global settings page allows you to update the following settings:

- **Document Visibility** - Set the default visibility of the documents created by team members. Learn more about [document visibility](/users/teams/document-visibility).
- **Sender Details** - Set whether the sender's name should be included in the emails sent by the team.

## Sender Details

If the **Sender Details** setting is enabled, the emails sent by the team will include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example User" on behalf of "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"

If the **Sender Details** setting is disabled, the emails sent by the team will not include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"
