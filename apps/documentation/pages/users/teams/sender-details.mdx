## Sender Details

If the **Sender Details** setting is enabled, the emails sent by the team will include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example User" on behalf of "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"

If the **Sender Details** setting is disabled, the emails sent by the team will not include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"
