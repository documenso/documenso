# Team's Document Visibility

The default document visibility is automatically set to the role of the user who created the document:

- If a user with the "User" role creates a document, the document's visibility is set to "Everyone".
- If a user with the "Manager" role creates a document, the document's visibility is set to
  "Managers and above".
- If a user with the "Admin" role creates a document, the document's
  visibility is set to "Admin only".

However, you can control the visibility of your documents by changing the document's visibility settings. To set the visibility of a document, click on the **Document visibility** dropdown in the document's settings panel.

The document visibility can be set to one of the following options:

- **Everyone** - The document is visible to all team members.
- **Managers and above** - The document is visible to people with the role of Manager or above.
- **Admin only** - The document is only visible to the team's admins.
