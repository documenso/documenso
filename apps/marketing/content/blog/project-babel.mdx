## Announcing Project Babel: Powering Documenso with Global Language Support

At Documenso, we believe that open source is more than just a software philosophy—it’s a way to build solutions that are open to all. Now, we’re happy to take that mission further with Project Babel, a community-driven initiative designed to bring worldwide language support to the Documenso platform. This project aims to enable Documenso to support as many languages as possible.

## Why Language Support Matters

We already have customers from 36 different countries and are seeing traffic from even more. When it comes to critical tools like signature platforms, having a user interface in your native language can make all the difference. No matter who and where you are, your team deserves tools that are fully accessible and intuitive. That’s why we’re making it our goal to support every language, and we need your help to make it happen! We’re building Documenso as a truly global public commodity.

## The Vision Behind Project Babel

The goal of Project Babel is simple but bold: We want to out-ship and out-customize every other document signing tool worldwide. How? By leveraging the collective power of our global community.

Unlike closed-source software, where localization means waiting for updates from the core team, Project Babel lets anyone contribute a new language, improve an existing translation, or customize the experience to meet local cultural nuances. This flexibility isn’t just a bonus—it’s the baseline for truly global products.

Through Project Babel, you can help make Documenso the most inclusive e-signature tool. Whether by adding a language you speak or fine-tuning existing translations, you’re shaping a platform that works for everyone, everywhere.

## How You Can Contribute

We’ve created a simple GitHub-based contribution flow to get started. We’ll improve the flow and user experience as the project progresses. As always, your contributions are highly valued.

## Open Source Makes It Possible

Closed-source solutions can’t keep up with the speed or depth of customization that open source offers. While other companies might take months or years to localize their products, Documenso can adapt and grow in real-time, thanks to contributions from our community. Whether it’s a small regional dialect or a widely spoken language, Project Babel ensures that Documenso evolves to meet the needs of people everywhere.

> More importantly, this initiative empowers users. It allows you to control your software experience, ensuring it reflects your culture, language, and unique needs.

Project Babel is more than a localization effort—it’s the first step toward democratizing access to highly customized software for everyone, no matter where they are or what language they speak. We’re incredibly excited about this initiative, but it can only succeed with your participation. We invite you to join us in making Documenso the most linguistically inclusive platform out there.
