# Prisma

Prisma is an open-source company known for its modern OSS ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools that simplify database interactions for developers. Their flagship product, Prisma ORM, provides a type-safe way to query databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL and many more. With the addition of Prisma Studio, an intuitive database management interface, Prisma makes it easier and more efficient for developers to work with databases. With their new addions Prisma Pulse and Accelerate you can react to database changes in realtime and optimize your queries. And their are completely [open source!](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)

# We choose Prisma too!

I discovered Prisma when planning the techsteck for the [first version of Documenso](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases/tag/0.9-developer-preview). Prisma felt natural to use from day one and has been the base of our database architecture ever since. It's great to see them develop and grow with us.

# Why they choose us

## 1. Signature Flows

Documenso signing flow are highly configurable using different roles, settings and delivery methodas (Email, Manual Link, Link created via API, Static Direct Link) to fit the needs of what you are tryinging to get signed.

## 2. Modern UX

We’ve designed Documenso with a sleek, modern interface that makes it super easy to use. Whether you're signing documents, managing workflows, or tweaking settings, the user-friendly design ensures you can get things done quickly and effortlessly. It's a tool that’s not just powerful, but also pleasant to use—perfect for anyone, regardless of their tech-savviness.

## 3. Teams

### Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Documenso makes teamwork a breeze with its team management features. You can easily set up and organize teams, making it simple to share and manage documents and workflows together. This is a lifesaver for larger organizations or teams spread across different departments, ensuring everyone stays in sync and on track. Different visibility scope ensure private documents stay privat and other are shared for easy collaboration.

### Document Visibility

Collaboration within a team often demands different levels of access to documents. For instance, the Documenso team at Prisma needed a way to set visibility on some documents while keeping others accessible to everyone. To address this need, we introduced role-based visibility scopes. This feature empowers teams to manage access effectively—certain documents can be set as visible only to managers, or in special cases, restricted to admins. This ensures sensitive information stays protected, while general documents remain accessible to those who need them.

## 4. OSS!

As you might know, we are open-source! This means you can peek under the hood, tweak things to your liking, and even contribute to making the platform better. We love the community-driven aspect of open-source, and it aligns perfectly with our goal to keep improving and innovating with input from our users.

So, whether you're looking to streamline your document workflows or just need a solid, reliable platform, Documenso has got your back. And we're thrilled to services another OSS company and help makeing their space more open.
