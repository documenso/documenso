# Prisma

Prisma is an open-source company known for its modern OSS ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools that simplify database interactions for developers. Their flagship product, Prisma ORM, provides a type-safe way to query databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and many more. With the addition of Prisma Studio, an intuitive database management interface, Prisma makes it easier and more efficient for developers to work with databases. With their new additions, Prisma Pulse and Accelerate, you can react to real-time database changes and optimize your queries. And they are completely [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)!

# We choose Prisma too!

I discovered Prisma when planning the tech stack for the [first version of Documenso](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases/tag/0.9-developer-preview). Prisma has felt natural to use since day one and has been the base of our database architecture ever since. It's great to see them develop and grow with us.

# Why they choose us

## 1. Signature Flows

Documenso signing flows are highly configurable, designed to adapt to the needs of any document signing process. Whether you're working with different roles, varying settings, or specific delivery methods, Documenso offers the flexibility to suit your requirements. You can choose to send documents via email, share a manual link, generate a link through the API, or even use a static direct link for quick access—all while ensuring a smooth signing experience.

Additionally, you can create templates to streamline and reuse common workflows, saving valuable time. Direct link templates enable users to drive the flow themselves, providing a straightforward path for signing. For a seamless experience, Documenso also allows you to embed the signing process directly into your website, ensuring an uninterrupted, integrated workflow tailored to your needs.

## 2. Modern UX

We’ve crafted Documenso with a sleek, modern interface that makes it incredibly easy to use. Whether you’re signing documents, managing workflows, or fine-tuning settings, its intuitive design allows you to accomplish tasks quickly and effortlessly. More than just powerful, Documenso is a pleasure to navigate—designed to be accessible to everyone, no matter their level of tech experience.

## 3. Teams

### Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

Documenso makes teamwork a breeze with its team management features. You can easily set up and organize teams, making it simple to share and manage documents and workflows together. This is a lifesaver for larger organizations or teams spread across different departments, ensuring everyone stays in sync and on track. Different visibility scopes ensure private documents stay private and others are shared for easy collaboration.

### Document Visibility

Collaboration within a team often demands different levels of access to documents. For instance, the Documenso team at Prisma needed a way to set custom visibility on some documents while keeping others accessible to everyone. To address this need, we introduced role-based visibility scopes. This feature allows teams to manage documents more effectively. They can make certain documents visible only to managers or, in special cases, restricted to admins. This ensures sensitive information stays protected while general documents remain accessible to those who need them.

## 4. OSS!

As you might know, we are open-source! This means you can peek under the hood, tweak things to your liking, and even contribute to making the platform better. We love the community-driven aspect of open-source, and it aligns perfectly with our goal to keep improving and innovating with input from our users.

So, whether you're looking to streamline your document workflows or just need a solid, reliable platform, Documenso has got your back. And we're thrilled to serve another OSS company and help make the space more open.
