import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## What You Need

Documenso requires the following external services:

| Service       | Purpose                      | Minimum Version |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| PostgreSQL    | Primary database             | 14+             |
| SMTP server   | Sending emails to recipients | Any             |
| Reverse proxy | SSL termination, routing     | Any             |

### PostgreSQL Database

Documenso uses PostgreSQL for all data storage including documents, users, and audit logs. You cannot use MySQL, SQLite, or other databases.

Documenso requires two connection strings:

- **Pooled connection** (`NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL`) - For general application queries
- **Direct connection** (`NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`) - For migrations and operations that require a direct connection

If you're not using a connection pooler (like PgBouncer), both can point to the same database URL.

### Email Server

Documenso sends transactional emails for:

- Document signing requests
- Signing reminders
- Completion notifications
- Password resets and verification

Supported transports:

| Transport      | Use Case                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `smtp-auth`    | Standard SMTP with username/password |
| `smtp-api`     | SMTP with API key authentication     |
| `resend`       | Resend.com API                       |
| `mailchannels` | MailChannels API                     |

<Callout type="warn">
  Without a working email configuration, recipients cannot receive signing requests. Configure email
  before going to production.
</Callout>

### Reverse Proxy

For production deployments, place Documenso behind a reverse proxy such as:

- nginx
- Caddy
- Traefik
- HAProxy
- Cloud load balancers (AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, etc.)

The reverse proxy handles SSL/TLS termination and forwards requests to Documenso on port 3000.

## Optional Services

These services are not required but improve functionality or scalability:

| Service               | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| S3-compatible storage | Store documents externally (recommended) |

### Document Storage

By default, Documenso stores documents in the PostgreSQL database. For production deployments with significant document volume, use S3-compatible storage:

- Amazon S3
- MinIO
- Cloudflare R2
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Any S3-compatible provider

See [Storage Configuration](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/storage) for setup details.

### Background Jobs

Documenso processes background jobs (email delivery, document processing) using a PostgreSQL-based queue. No additional services like Redis are required: the job queue is built into the application and uses your existing database.

For high-throughput deployments, Documenso optionally supports [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) as an alternative job provider. Set `NEXT_PRIVATE_JOBS_PROVIDER=inngest` and configure `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` and `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`. Most self-hosted instances do not need this.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum (Testing/Development)

| Resource | Requirement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| CPU      | 1 core      |
| RAM      | 1 GB        |
| Storage  | 10 GB       |

### Recommended (Production)

| Resource | Requirement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| CPU      | 2+ cores    |
| RAM      | 2+ GB       |
| Storage  | 20+ GB      |

<Callout type="info">
  Storage requirements depend on document volume. If using external S3 storage, local storage needs
  are minimal. If storing documents in the database, plan for growth accordingly.
</Callout>

---

## Build Requirements

If building from source (not using Docker images):

| Requirement | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Node.js     | 18+     |
| npm         | 8+      |

---

## Supported Platforms

Documenso runs on:

- **Linux** - Any modern distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Alpine)
- **Docker** - Official images available on DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry
- **Kubernetes** - Helm charts and manifests available
- **PaaS providers** - Railway, Render, Koyeb (one-click deploys available)

---

## What's NOT Supported

<Callout type="error">
  The following configurations are not supported and may not work correctly.
</Callout>

| Configuration  | Reason                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Windows native | Use Docker or WSL2 instead            |
| MySQL/MariaDB  | PostgreSQL-specific features required |
| SQLite         | Not suitable for production workloads |
| MongoDB        | Relational database required          |
| Node.js < 18   | Modern JavaScript features required   |

## Checklist

Before proceeding to deployment, confirm you have:

- [ ] PostgreSQL 14+ database accessible
- [ ] SMTP credentials or email provider API key
- [ ] Signing certificate (`.p12`) for document signing — see [Tips](/docs/self-hosting/getting-started/tips)
- [ ] Domain name for your Documenso instance
- [ ] SSL certificate (or reverse proxy that handles SSL)
- [ ] Server meeting minimum hardware requirements
