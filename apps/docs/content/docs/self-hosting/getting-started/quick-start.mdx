import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Limitations

This quick start setup is for local development and testing only:

- No HTTPS (not suitable for production)
- No email delivery (emails are logged to console)
- Uses a local PostgreSQL database
- No signing certificate configured (documents will be signed with a generated certificate)
- Single-node setup (no high availability)

For production deployments, see [Docker Compose Deployment](/docs/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v2.0 or later
- At least 2GB of available RAM

Verify your installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/documenso/documenso.git
cd documenso
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create the environment file

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The default values work for local development. No changes are required.

</Step>

<Step>
### Start Documenso

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml up -d
```

This pulls the required images and starts the containers. The first run takes a few minutes.

</Step>

<Step>
### Access the application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Create Your First Account

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **Sign Up** on the login page
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter your email address and create a password
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Check the Docker logs for the verification email (emails are not sent in development mode):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs -f
```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the verification link from the logs and open it in your browser
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Log in with your credentials
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  In development mode, all emails are logged to the console instead of being sent. Look for the
  verification link in the container logs.
</Callout>

## What's Included

The quick start setup runs the following containers:

| Container   | Purpose                          | Port  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- |
| `documenso` | Main application                 | 3000  |
| `database`  | PostgreSQL database              | 54320 |
| `maildev`   | Local email testing server       | 2500  |
| `minio`     | S3-compatible storage (optional) | 9000  |

## Useful Commands

**View logs:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs -f
```

**Stop containers:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml down
```

**Stop and remove all data:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml down -v
```

**Rebuild after changes:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml up -d --build
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Port 3000 already in use">
    Another application is using port 3000. Either stop that application or change the port in your
    `.env` file: `PORT=3001`. Then restart the containers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Container fails to start">
    Check the logs: `docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs documenso`. Common
    issues: insufficient memory (ensure Docker has at least 2GB RAM allocated), database connection
    (wait for the database container to be healthy before the app starts).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot access localhost:3000">
    Verify containers are running: `docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml ps`. Check if
    the app container is healthy. On Linux, ensure Docker is not running in rootless mode with
    network restrictions.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
