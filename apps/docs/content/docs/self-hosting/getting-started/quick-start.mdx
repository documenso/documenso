description: Get Documenso running locally in minutes with Docker Compose.

This guide gets Documenso running on your machine using Docker Compose. The setup takes about 5 minutes and includes everything you need to test document signing locally.

## Limitations

This quick start setup is for local development and testing only:

- No HTTPS (not suitable for production)
- No email delivery (emails are logged to console)
- Uses a local PostgreSQL database
- No signing certificate configured (documents will be signed with a generated certificate)
- Single-node setup (no high availability)

For production deployments, see [Docker Compose Deployment](/docs/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v2.0 or later
- At least 2GB of available RAM

Verify your installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>
### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/documenso/documenso.git
cd documenso
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create the environment file

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The default values work for local development. No changes are required.

</Step>

<Step>
### Start Documenso

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml up -d
```

This pulls the required images and starts the containers. The first run takes a few minutes.

</Step>

<Step>
### Access the application

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Create Your First Account

1. Click **Sign Up** on the login page
2. Enter your email address and create a password
3. Check the Docker logs for the verification email (emails are not sent in development mode):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs -f
```

4. Copy the verification link from the logs and open it in your browser
5. Log in with your credentials

<Callout type="info">
  In development mode, all emails are logged to the console instead of being sent. Look for the
  verification link in the container logs.
</Callout>

## What's Included

The quick start setup runs the following containers:

| Container   | Purpose                          | Port  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- |
| `documenso` | Main application                 | 3000  |
| `database`  | PostgreSQL database              | 54320 |
| `maildev`   | Local email testing server       | 2500  |
| `minio`     | S3-compatible storage (optional) | 9000  |

## Useful Commands

**View logs:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs -f
```

**Stop containers:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml down
```

**Stop and remove all data:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml down -v
```

**Rebuild after changes:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml up -d --build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use

Another application is using port 3000. Either stop that application or change the port in your `.env` file:

```bash
PORT=3001
```

Then restart the containers.

### Container fails to start

Check the logs for error messages:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml logs documenso
```

Common issues:

- Insufficient memory: Ensure Docker has at least 2GB RAM allocated
- Database connection: Wait for the database container to be healthy before the app starts

### Cannot access localhost:3000

- Verify containers are running: `docker compose -f docker/development/compose.yml ps`
- Check if the app container is healthy
- On Linux, ensure Docker is not running in rootless mode with network restrictions

## Next Steps

- [Docker Compose Deployment](/docs/self-hosting/deployment/docker-compose) - Production-ready setup with HTTPS and email
- [Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/environment) - Configure all available options
- [Signing Certificate](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/signing-certificate) - Set up document signing
- [Email Configuration](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/email) - Configure SMTP for production
