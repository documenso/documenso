When a document is completed in Documenso, it is digitally signed using an X.509 certificate. This cryptographic signature provides:

- Proof of document authenticity
- Verification that the document has not been modified since signing
- Identity information about the signing entity

Self-hosted Documenso instances require a signing certificate. You can generate a self-signed certificate or purchase one from a Certificate Authority (CA).

## Certificate Options

<Tabs items={['Self-Signed', 'CA-Issued', 'Google Cloud HSM']}>
<Tab value="Self-Signed">

A self-signed certificate is sufficient for most use cases where your industry has no special signing regulations.

**Advantages:**

- Free to create
- Full control over certificate details
- Works for internal and business documents

**Limitations:**

- PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat will not show a green checkmark
- Not recognized by Adobe's trust list
- Recipients see a warning that the signature cannot be verified

The certificate still includes your organisation details and guarantees document integrity.

</Tab>
<Tab value="CA-Issued">

Purchase a certificate from a Certificate Authority if you need:

- Green checkmark in Adobe PDF readers
- Industry-specific compliance requirements
- Third-party signature validation

For Adobe recognition, choose a vendor from the [Adobe Approved Trust List](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list1.html).

</Tab>
<Tab value="Google Cloud HSM">

For organisations requiring hardware-based key protection, Documenso supports Google Cloud HSM. This provides:

- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified key storage
- Keys never leave the HSM
- Audit logging of all cryptographic operations

See [Google Cloud HSM](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/signing-certificate/google-cloud-hsm) for setup instructions.
