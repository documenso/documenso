## Prerequisites

Before deploying, you need:

- A [Railway account](https://railway.app/) (free tier available)
- SMTP credentials for sending emails (required for document signing requests)
- A custom domain (optional but recommended for production)

## One-Click Deploy

The fastest way to deploy Documenso on Railway is using the official template:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/bG6D4p)

This template automatically provisions:

- Documenso application service
- PostgreSQL database
- Required environment variables with secure defaults

<Steps>
<Step>
### Click the deploy button

Click the "Deploy on Railway" button above. You'll be redirected to Railway and prompted to log in if needed.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure environment variables

Railway will prompt you to configure required variables. At minimum, set:

| Variable                         | Description                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL`         | The public URL for your deployment (use the Railway-provided URL initially, update later if using a custom domain) |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_HOST`         | Your SMTP server hostname                                                                                          |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PORT`         | SMTP port (typically 587 or 465)                                                                                   |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_USERNAME`     | SMTP username                                                                                                      |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PASSWORD`     | SMTP password                                                                                                      |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` | Sender email address                                                                                               |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_NAME`    | Sender display name                                                                                                |

The template automatically generates secure values for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy

Click "Deploy" to start the deployment. Railway builds the application from the Dockerfile and provisions the database.

This takes approximately 5-10 minutes for the initial build.

</Step>

<Step>
### Access your deployment

Once deployed, Railway provides a URL like `documenso-production.up.railway.app`.

Click the URL in the Railway dashboard to access your Documenso instance.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer more control over the setup, deploy Documenso manually:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a new project

- Log in to [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
- Fork or select the [Documenso repository](https://github.com/documenso/documenso)

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure the build

Railway automatically detects the `railway.toml` configuration file in the repository, which specifies:

```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "/docker/Dockerfile"
```

No additional build configuration is needed.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add PostgreSQL database

- In your project, click "New"
- Select "Database"
- Choose "PostgreSQL"
- Railway provisions the database and automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure environment variables

Click on the Documenso service and go to the "Variables" tab. Add the following variables:

**Required variables:**

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<minimum 32 character random string>
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY=<minimum 32 character random string>
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL=https://<your-railway-url>.up.railway.app
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT=smtp-auth
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_HOST=<your-smtp-host>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PORT=587
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_USERNAME=<your-smtp-username>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PASSWORD=<your-smtp-password>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_NAME=Documenso
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

<Callout type="info">
  Use `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` to reference the Railway-managed PostgreSQL connection string. Railway automatically resolves this reference.
</Callout>

**Optional variables:**

| Variable                          | Description                        | Default |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| `PORT`                            | Application port                   | `3000`  |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_SIGNUP`      | Disable public signups             | `false` |
| `NEXT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase for signing certificate | -       |
| `DOCUMENSO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`     | Disable anonymous telemetry        | `false` |

</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy

Click "Deploy" or push a commit to trigger a new deployment. Railway builds and deploys the application automatically.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Variables

Railway manages environment variables through its dashboard. The full list of configuration options is documented in [Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/environment).

### Referencing Railway Services

Railway allows referencing other services in your project using the `${{ServiceName.VARIABLE}}` syntax:

```bash
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

This ensures connection strings stay in sync when Railway updates service configurations.

## Database Setup

Railway's managed PostgreSQL handles database provisioning automatically. The database:

- Runs PostgreSQL 15 by default
- Includes automatic backups on paid plans
- Provides connection pooling via the internal network

### Database Connection

For Railway deployments, use the same connection string for both pooled and direct connections:

```bash
NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

Documenso runs database migrations automatically on startup.

### Accessing the Database

To connect directly to your database for debugging or maintenance:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Open the PostgreSQL service

In your Railway project dashboard, select the PostgreSQL service.

</Step>
<Step>
### Open the Connect tab

The "Connect" tab shows the connection string and credentials.

</Step>
<Step>
### Connect with your client

Use the provided connection string with your preferred PostgreSQL client.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Domain

Railway provides a generated URL by default. To use your own domain:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Generate a domain

- Click on your Documenso service
- Go to "Settings" > "Networking"
- Click "Generate Domain" to get a Railway subdomain, or proceed to add a custom domain

</Step>

<Step>
### Add custom domain

- In "Settings" > "Networking", click "Custom Domain"
- Enter your domain (e.g., `sign.yourdomain.com`)
- Railway provides DNS records to configure

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure DNS

Add the following DNS records at your domain registrar:

| Type  | Name | Value                           |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| CNAME | sign | `<your-project>.up.railway.app` |

DNS propagation can take up to 24 hours.

</Step>

<Step>
### Update environment variable

Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` to match your custom domain:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL=https://sign.yourdomain.com
```

Railway automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates for custom domains.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Scaling Options

Railway provides several options for scaling your Documenso deployment:

### Vertical Scaling

Increase resources for your service:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Open your Documenso service

In the Railway dashboard, select the Documenso service.

</Step>
<Step>
### Open Settings

In "Settings" you can change the resource limits for the service.

</Step>
<Step>
### Adjust memory and CPU

Raise the memory and CPU limits; Railway will scale within these limits based on demand.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Horizontal Scaling

Railway supports horizontal scaling through replicas:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Open service Settings

In the Railway dashboard, select your Documenso service and open "Settings".

</Step>
<Step>
### Enable Horizontal Scaling

Turn on "Horizontal Scaling" so Railway can run multiple instances.

</Step>
<Step>
### Set replicas

Choose how many replicas to run; Railway will load-balance traffic across them.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  Documenso stores sessions in the database, so horizontal scaling works without additional
  configuration. However, ensure your database can handle the increased connection load.
</Callout>

### Database Scaling

For high-traffic deployments:

- Upgrade to a larger PostgreSQL instance in Railway
- Consider using connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Configure read replicas for read-heavy workloads

## Cost Estimate

Railway uses usage-based pricing. Estimated monthly costs for Documenso:

| Tier  | Resources                          | Estimated Cost |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Trial | $5 credit, limited hours           | Free           |
| Hobby | 512MB RAM, shared CPU              | $5-10/month    |
| Pro   | 2GB RAM, dedicated CPU             | $20-40/month   |
| Team  | Custom resources, priority support | $50+/month     |

Actual costs depend on:

- Application memory usage (typically 500MB-1GB)
- Database size and query volume
- Egress bandwidth
- Number of deployments

<Callout type="info">
  Railway charges based on actual resource consumption. Monitor usage in the Railway dashboard to
  optimize costs.
</Callout>

### Free Tier Limitations

Railway's trial tier includes:

- $5 of free credit
- 500 hours of execution time per month
- Limited to 512MB RAM per service

This is sufficient for testing but not recommended for production.

## Signing Certificate

Documenso requires a signing certificate to sign documents. On Railway, you can:

### Option 1: Use Generated Certificate (Default)

Documenso generates a self-signed certificate automatically if none is provided. This works for testing but shows generic certificate information in signed documents.

### Option 2: Mount Custom Certificate

For production use, provide your own certificate:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Base64-encode your certificate

Run this and copy the output (single line, no newlines):

```bash
base64 -i your-cert.p12 | tr -d '\n'
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Add environment variables in Railway

In your Documenso service variables, set:

```bash
NEXT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_LOCAL_FILE_CONTENTS=<base64-encoded-certificate>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SIGNING_PASSPHRASE=<certificate-password>
```

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  Your certificate must have a password. Certificates without passwords cause signing errors.
</Callout>

See [Signing Certificate Configuration](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/signing-certificate) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Build fails">
    Check the build logs in Railway for specific errors. Common causes: out of memory (increase the build memory limit in service settings), Docker build timeout (Railway has a 20-minute build timeout; ensure your build completes within this limit).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Application crashes on startup">
    View the deployment logs: click your service, go to Deployments, click the failed deployment. Common issues: missing environment variables (verify all required variables are set), database connection failed (check `NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL` references the correct PostgreSQL service), invalid encryption keys (ensure keys are at least 32 characters).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emails not sending">
    Verify SMTP configuration: check `NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT` is set to `smtp-auth`, verify SMTP credentials are correct, ensure your SMTP provider allows connections from Railway's IP addresses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Database connection errors">
    Verify PostgreSQL service is running, check the variable reference syntax `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`, try redeploying the application.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slow performance">
    Increase memory allocation for the service, check database query performance in Railway's metrics, consider upgrading to a larger PostgreSQL instance.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
