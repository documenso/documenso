## Overview

Documenso enforces rate limits on all API endpoints to ensure service stability.

## HTTP Rate Limits

**Limit:** 100 requests per minute per IP address  
**Response:** 429 Too Many Requests

### Rate Limit Response

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  No rate limit headers are currently provided. When you receive a 429 response, wait at least 60
  seconds before retrying.
</Callout>

## Resource Limits

Beyond HTTP rate limits, your account has usage limits based on your subscription plan.

### Plan Limits

| Resource         | Free | Paid      | Self-hosted | Enterprise |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Documents/month  | 5    | Unlimited | Unlimited   | Unlimited  |
| Total Recipients | 10   | Unlimited | Unlimited   | Unlimited  |
| Direct Templates | 3    | Unlimited | Unlimited   | Unlimited  |

### Error Response

When you exceed a resource limit:

```json
{
  "error": "You have reached your document limit for this month. Please upgrade your plan.",
  "code": "LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code                | Status | Description                   |
