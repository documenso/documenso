# Webhooks

Webhooks notify your application when events occur in Documenso, such as when a document is signed or completed.

## How Webhooks Work

1. You configure a webhook URL in Documenso
2. When an event occurs, Documenso sends an HTTP POST to your URL
3. Your application processes the event and responds with 200 OK
