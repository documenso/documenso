    ## Community Edition (AGPL-3.0)

    The Community Edition is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0). This is a copyleft license that preserves software freedom.

    ### What AGPL-3.0 Allows

    - Use Documenso for any purpose, including commercial use
    - Access, study, and modify the source code
    - Distribute copies of the original or modified software
    - Self-host Documenso on your own infrastructure

    ### What AGPL-3.0 Requires

    The AGPL-3.0 has specific requirements that apply when you modify or distribute Documenso:

    **Source Code Disclosure**: If you modify Documenso and make it available over a network, you must provide access to the complete source code of your modified version under AGPL-3.0.

    **Attribution**: You must keep all copyright notices intact and include a copy of the AGPL-3.0 license with any distribution.

    **Same License**: Derivative works must be licensed under AGPL-3.0.

    <Callout type="info">
      The "network clause" is the distinguishing feature of AGPL-3.0. Unlike GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0 treats
      network access as distribution. If users interact with your modified Documenso instance over a
      network, you must provide them access to the source code.
    </Callout>

    ### When to Use Community Edition

    The Community Edition is appropriate when you:

    - Are building an open-source project
    - Can comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements
    - Use Documenso internally without modifications
    - Want to contribute to the open-source ecosystem
    - Do not need to keep modifications proprietary

    See [Community Edition](/docs/policies/community-edition) for complete details.

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Enterprise Edition">
    ## Enterprise Edition (Commercial License)

    The Enterprise Edition provides a commercial license that removes the AGPL-3.0 requirements. This allows organizations to use, modify, and integrate Documenso without source code disclosure obligations.

    ### What the Enterprise License Provides

    **No Source Code Disclosure**: Keep your modifications private. You are not required to share changes with users or the public.

    **Proprietary Integration**: Integrate Documenso into proprietary products and services without licensing conflicts.

    **Commercial Support**: Access to dedicated support channels and SLAs.

    **Additional Features**: Enterprise-specific features not available in the Community Edition.

    ### When to Use Enterprise Edition

    The Enterprise Edition is appropriate when you:

    - Build commercial products that incorporate Documenso
    - Offer document signing as part of a SaaS platform
    - Cannot or prefer not to open-source your modifications
    - Need to comply with corporate policies that prohibit AGPL software
    - Require dedicated support and SLAs

    <Callout type="warn">
      If you modify Documenso and provide network access to users (internal or external) without
      complying with AGPL-3.0 source disclosure requirements, you need an Enterprise license.
    </Callout>

    See [Enterprise Edition](/docs/policies/enterprise-edition) for complete details and pricing.

## Choosing the Right License

Use this decision tree to determine which license fits your needs:

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Do you modify Documenso?">
    **No modifications**: Both licenses work. Community Edition is free and sufficient if you run Documenso as-is.

    **Yes, with modifications**: Continue to the next question.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are your modifications available as open source?">
    **Yes, under AGPL-3.0**: Community Edition is appropriate. Your modifications must be available to users who access your instance.

    **No, modifications are proprietary**: Enterprise Edition is required.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are you embedding Documenso in a commercial product?">
    **Open-source product under AGPL-3.0**: Community Edition is appropriate.

    **Proprietary product**: Enterprise Edition is required.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Internal use only?">
    Using Documenso internally without providing network access to external users does not trigger AGPL-3.0 distribution requirements. However, if your organization has policies against AGPL software or you make modifications you want to keep private, consider the Enterprise Edition.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## License FAQ

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Can I use the Community Edition for commercial purposes?">
    Yes. AGPL-3.0 permits commercial use. You must comply with the license terms, including source
    code disclosure if you modify and distribute or provide network access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does using the Documenso API require a commercial license?">
    No. Calling the Documenso API from your application does not create a derivative work. Your
    application remains under your chosen license. However, if you modify Documenso itself and
    provide network access, AGPL-3.0 requirements apply.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='What counts as a "modification" under AGPL-3.0?'>
    Modifying the source code, forking the repository and making changes, or linking Documenso
    libraries into your application in a way that creates a combined work. Configuration changes and
    using Documenso through its API are not modifications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I white-label Documenso?">
    You can change branding for your deployment under both licenses. Under AGPL-3.0, you must retain
    copyright notices and license information in the source code. Under the Enterprise license, you
    have more flexibility with branding requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do signed documents fall under the license?">
    No. The license applies to the software, not content created with the software. Documents you
    sign are your property and are not subject to AGPL-3.0.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I switch from Community to Enterprise Edition?">
    Your existing deployments can transition to the Enterprise license. Contact
    [sales](https://documen.so/enterprise) to discuss migration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I contribute to Documenso under the Enterprise license?">
    Contributions to the main Documenso repository are licensed under AGPL-3.0. The Enterprise
    license applies only to your private use and modifications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a trial for the Enterprise Edition?">
    Contact [sales](https://documen.so/enterprise) to discuss evaluation options.
  </Accordion>
