description: Usage guidelines and limits for Documenso services

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

This policy defines fair use guidelines for Documenso Cloud. These guidelines ensure reliable service for all users and prevent abuse. Self-hosted deployments are not subject to these limits.

## Cloud Service Guidelines

Documenso Cloud is designed for standard document signing workflows. The following guidelines apply to all cloud plans:

- Use the service for its intended purpose: sending documents for signature
- Respect the limits associated with your subscription plan
- Do not use automated systems to circumvent usage limits
- Do not share account credentials to bypass per-user limits

Fair use is evaluated based on typical usage patterns for document signing. Occasional spikes in usage are expected and accommodated.

## Rate Limits

API and application requests are rate-limited to protect service availability.

| Endpoint Type     | Limit                  | Window     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| API requests      | 100 requests           | Per minute |
| Document creation | 50 documents           | Per hour   |
| Email sending     | 200 emails             | Per hour   |
| Bulk operations   | 20 concurrent requests | Per minute |

Rate limits apply per user or API token. When a limit is reached, requests return a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response includes a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.

  Rate limits may vary by plan. Enterprise plans include higher limits. Contact sales@documenso.com

## Storage Limits

Document storage is subject to the following guidelines:

| Plan       | Document Storage | Retention                |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Free       | 10 documents     | 60 days after completion |
| Individual | Unlimited        | Until deleted            |
| Teams      | Unlimited        | Until deleted            |
| Enterprise | Unlimited        | Configurable retention   |

### Storage Guidelines

- **Document size**: Maximum 20 MB per PDF file
- **Page count**: Maximum 500 pages per document
- **Recipients**: Maximum 50 recipients per document
- **Fields**: Maximum 500 fields per document

Documents exceeding these limits may fail to upload or process.

## Acceptable Use

The following uses are permitted under fair use:

- Sending contracts, agreements, and forms for signature
- Using templates for recurring document types
- Integrating with business applications via the API
- Automating document workflows within rate limits

### Prohibited Uses

The following uses violate fair use and may result in account action:

- **Bulk email**: Using document signing as a mass email delivery system
- **Storage abuse**: Uploading documents without intent to sign them
- **API abuse**: Automated scraping, excessive polling, or denial-of-service patterns
- **Credential sharing**: Sharing login credentials to exceed per-seat limits
- **Circumvention**: Using multiple accounts to bypass usage limits

<Callout type="warn">
  Violation of acceptable use policies may result in rate limiting, account suspension, or
  termination. See [Terms of Service](/docs/policies/terms) for details.
</Callout>

## Limit Exceeded Actions

When usage exceeds fair use limits, Documenso may take the following actions:

### Soft Limits

For minor or temporary limit violations:

1. **Warning notification**: Email notification about the exceeded limit
2. **Temporary throttling**: Reduced rate limits until usage normalizes
3. **Grace period**: Time to reduce usage or upgrade your plan

### Hard Limits

For significant or repeated violations:

1. **Service restriction**: Affected features are disabled until resolved
2. **Account review**: Manual review of usage patterns
3. **Account suspension**: Temporary suspension pending resolution
4. **Termination**: Permanent account closure for severe or repeated abuse

Before taking action, Documenso will attempt to contact you at your registered email address. You will have an opportunity to explain unusual usage or upgrade your plan.

### Disputing Actions

If you believe an action was taken in error:

1. Reply to the notification email with details about your usage
2. Provide context for any unusual patterns
3. Request a review of the decision

Disputes are reviewed within 5 business days.
