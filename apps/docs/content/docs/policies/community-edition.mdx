The Community Edition is the open-source version of Documenso, available to everyone under the AGPL-3.0 license. It includes the core document signing functionality and can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure.

## AGPL-3.0 License Overview

The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0) is a copyleft license designed to ensure software freedom. It is similar to GPL-3.0 but includes an additional "network clause" that addresses software-as-a-service use cases.

Key characteristics:

- **Copyleft**: Derivative works must use the same license
- **Network clause**: Network access triggers the same obligations as distribution
- **Source availability**: Users must be able to access the source code

The full license text is available in the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/blob/main/LICENSE) in the repository.

## What You Can Do

Under the AGPL-3.0 license, you are permitted to:

| Action             | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use**            | Run Documenso for any purpose, including commercial use       |
| **Study**          | Access and examine the complete source code                   |
| **Modify**         | Make changes and customizations to the software               |
| **Distribute**     | Share copies of the original or modified software             |
| **Self-host**      | Deploy on your own servers, cloud infrastructure, or locally  |
| **Offer services** | Provide document signing services to users (with obligations) |

## What You Must Do

When using or distributing the Community Edition, you must comply with these requirements:

### Source Code Disclosure

If you modify Documenso and make it available over a network, you must:

- Provide access to the complete source code of your modified version
- Make the source available through the same network interface, or provide a written offer to supply it
- Include all scripts and instructions needed to build and install the software

<Callout type="warn">
  The network clause is the distinguishing feature of AGPL-3.0. If users interact with your modified
  Documenso instance over a network (whether internal or external), you must provide them access to
  the source code.
</Callout>

### Attribution

You must maintain proper attribution:

- Keep all copyright notices intact in the source code
- Include a copy of the AGPL-3.0 license with any distribution
- Clearly state any modifications you have made
- Preserve author attributions and license headers

### License Continuity

Derivative works must be licensed under AGPL-3.0:

- Forks must use the same license
- Modifications cannot be made proprietary
- Combined works that incorporate Documenso code are subject to AGPL-3.0
