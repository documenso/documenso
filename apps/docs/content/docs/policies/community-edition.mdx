## AGPL-3.0 License Overview

The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0) is a copyleft license designed to ensure software freedom. It is similar to GPL-3.0 but includes an additional "network clause" that addresses software-as-a-service use cases.

Key characteristics:

- **Copyleft**: Derivative works must use the same license
- **Network clause**: Network access triggers the same obligations as distribution
- **Source availability**: Users must be able to access the source code

The full license text is available in the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/blob/main/LICENSE) in the repository.

## What You Can Do

Under the AGPL-3.0 license, you are permitted to:

| Action             | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use**            | Run Documenso for any purpose, including commercial use       |
| **Study**          | Access and examine the complete source code                   |
| **Modify**         | Make changes and customizations to the software               |
| **Distribute**     | Share copies of the original or modified software             |
| **Self-host**      | Deploy on your own servers, cloud infrastructure, or locally  |
| **Offer services** | Provide document signing services to users (with obligations) |

## What You Must Do

When using or distributing the Community Edition, you must comply with these requirements:

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Source Code Disclosure">
    If you modify Documenso and make it available over a network, you must:

    - Provide access to the complete source code of your modified version
    - Make the source available through the same network interface, or provide a written offer to supply it
    - Include all scripts and instructions needed to build and install the software

    <Callout type="warn">
      The network clause is the distinguishing feature of AGPL-3.0. If users interact with your modified
      Documenso instance over a network (whether internal or external), you must provide them access to
      the source code.
    </Callout>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Attribution">
    You must maintain proper attribution:

    - Keep all copyright notices intact in the source code
    - Include a copy of the AGPL-3.0 license with any distribution
    - Clearly state any modifications you have made
    - Preserve author attributions and license headers

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="License Continuity">
    Derivative works must be licensed under AGPL-3.0:

    - Forks must use the same license
    - Modifications cannot be made proprietary
    - Combined works that incorporate Documenso code are subject to AGPL-3.0

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enterprise Edition Boundary">
    Features located in the `packages/ee/` directory of the codebase are not licensed under AGPL-3.0 and require an active [Enterprise license](/docs/policies/enterprise-edition) to use. If you are self-hosting the Community Edition, do not enable or use features from the `packages/ee/` folder without an enterprise license.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## When to Consider Enterprise Edition

The Community Edition is appropriate for many use cases. However, you may need the Enterprise Edition if you:

- Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 source disclosure requirements
- Need to keep modifications proprietary
- Require dedicated support with guaranteed response times
- Need enterprise-specific features (SSO, advanced audit logs, etc.)
- Have corporate policies that prohibit AGPL-licensed software

See [Enterprise Edition](/docs/policies/enterprise-edition) for details on commercial licensing.
