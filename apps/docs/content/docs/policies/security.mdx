## Security Practices

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Development Security">
    - **Code review**: All code changes require review before merging - **Dependency management**:
    Dependencies are regularly updated and monitored for vulnerabilities - **Static analysis**:
    Automated security scanning is part of the CI/CD pipeline - **Open source**: The codebase is
    publicly available for security review at
    [github.com/documenso/documenso](https://github.com/documenso/documenso)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access Controls">
    - **Role-based access**: Teams support member, manager, and admin roles with distinct
    permissions - **API token scoping**: API tokens can be scoped to specific teams and set with
    expiration dates - **Session management**: Users can view and revoke active sessions - **Audit
    logging**: Document actions are logged with timestamps and IP addresses
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Infrastructure Security

### Documenso Cloud

The hosted cloud service uses the following security measures:

| Layer          | Implementation                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hosting**    | Infrastructure hosted in EU data centers               |
| **Network**    | TLS 1.2+ for all connections                           |
| **Database**   | Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups              |
| **Storage**    | Encrypted object storage for documents                 |
| **Monitoring** | 24/7 infrastructure monitoring and alerting            |
| **Updates**    | Regular security patches applied to all infrastructure |

### Self-Hosted

Self-hosted deployments are responsible for their own infrastructure security. See [Self-Hosted Security Considerations](#self-hosted-security-considerations) below.

## Data Encryption

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Encryption in Transit">
    All data transmitted to and from Documenso is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. This includes:

    - Web application traffic
    - API requests
    - Email delivery (when supported by the receiving server)
    - Webhook payloads

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Encryption at Rest">
    For Documenso Cloud:

    - Database contents are encrypted at rest
    - Document storage uses encrypted object storage
    - Backups are encrypted

    For self-hosted deployments, encryption at rest depends on your infrastructure configuration.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Application-Level Encryption">
    Documenso encrypts sensitive data at the application level:

    - Encryption keys are configured via `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY`
    - Session tokens are signed using `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
    - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Authentication Security

### Supported Authentication Methods

| Method                        | Description                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Email and password**        | Traditional authentication with hashed passwords |
| **OAuth providers**           | Google and Microsoft authentication              |
| **Generic OIDC**              | Any OpenID Connect provider                      |
| **Team SSO**                  | SAML-based single sign-on for enterprise teams   |
| **Two-factor authentication** | TOTP-based 2FA with recovery codes               |
| **Passkeys**                  | WebAuthn-based passwordless authentication       |

### Password Requirements

- Minimum length enforced
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Password reset tokens are time-limited and single-use

### Session Security

- Sessions can be viewed and revoked from account settings
- Session tokens are rotated on authentication events
- Idle sessions expire after a configurable period

## Vulnerability Disclosure

Documenso operates a responsible disclosure process for security vulnerabilities.

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Reporting a Vulnerability">
    If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing:

    **security@documenso.com**

    Include the following information:

    - Description of the vulnerability
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Potential impact
    - Any suggested fixes (optional)

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Response Timeline">
    | Stage                 | Timeline            |
    | --------------------- | ------------------- |
    | **Acknowledgment**    | Within 48 hours     |
    | **Initial triage**    | Within 5 days       |
    | **Status update**     | Within 10 days      |
    | **Resolution target** | Depends on severity |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scope">
    <Tabs items={['In scope', 'Out of scope']}>
      <Tab value="In scope">
        The following are in scope for vulnerability reports:

        - Documenso application code
        - Authentication and authorization flaws
        - Data exposure vulnerabilities
        - Injection vulnerabilities
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
        - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="Out of scope">
        The following are out of scope:

        - Social engineering attacks
        - Denial of service attacks
        - Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the upstream project)
        - Issues requiring physical access to a user's device
        - Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recognition">
    We acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. With your permission, we will credit you when the fix is released.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Callout type="warn">
  Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they have been addressed. Public disclosure of
  unpatched vulnerabilities puts users at risk.
</Callout>

## Security Updates

### Notification

Security updates are announced through:

- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases)
- [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/security/advisories)

### Update Policy

- Critical vulnerabilities are patched as quickly as possible
- Security patches are backported to supported versions when feasible
- Release notes include security-related changes

### Staying Updated

For self-hosted deployments:

1. Watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/documenso/documenso) for releases
2. Subscribe to security advisories
3. Apply updates promptly, especially security patches

See [Upgrades](/docs/self-hosting/maintenance/upgrades) for update procedures.

## Self-Hosted Security Considerations

When self-hosting Documenso, you are responsible for the security of your deployment. The following recommendations apply:

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure">
    - **Use HTTPS**: Configure TLS certificates for all traffic - **Firewall rules**: Restrict
    access to necessary ports only - **Network isolation**: Place the database on a private network
    - **Regular updates**: Keep the host OS and dependencies updated
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configuration">
    - **Strong secrets**: Generate cryptographically random values for: - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` -
    `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY` - **Database security**:
    Use strong passwords and restrict database access - **Environment variables**: Store secrets
    securely (do not commit to version control)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Operations">
    - **Backups**: Implement regular encrypted backups - **Monitoring**: Set up logging and alerting
    for security events - **Access control**: Limit who has access to the server and database -
    **Incident response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Signing Certificates">
    - Store signing certificates securely - Use hardware security modules (HSM) for high-security
    requirements - Rotate certificates according to your security policy
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

See [Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/environment) for security-related configuration options.

<Callout type="info">
  Self-hosted deployments have full control over security but also full responsibility. Consider
  your organization's security requirements and compliance obligations when configuring your
  deployment.
</Callout>
