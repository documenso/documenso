## Security Practices

### Development Security

- **Code review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Dependency management**: Dependencies are regularly updated and monitored for vulnerabilities
- **Static analysis**: Automated security scanning is part of the CI/CD pipeline
- **Open source**: The codebase is publicly available for security review at [github.com/documenso/documenso](https://github.com/documenso/documenso)

### Access Controls

- **Role-based access**: Teams support member, manager, and admin roles with distinct permissions
- **API token scoping**: API tokens can be scoped to specific teams and set with expiration dates
- **Session management**: Users can view and revoke active sessions
- **Audit logging**: Document actions are logged with timestamps and IP addresses

## Infrastructure Security

### Documenso Cloud

The hosted cloud service uses the following security measures:

| Layer          | Implementation                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hosting**    | Infrastructure hosted in EU data centers               |
| **Network**    | TLS 1.2+ for all connections                           |
| **Database**   | Managed PostgreSQL with automated backups              |
| **Storage**    | Encrypted object storage for documents                 |
| **Monitoring** | 24/7 infrastructure monitoring and alerting            |
| **Updates**    | Regular security patches applied to all infrastructure |

### Self-Hosted

Self-hosted deployments are responsible for their own infrastructure security. See [Self-Hosted Security Considerations](#self-hosted-security-considerations) below.

## Data Encryption

### Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted to and from Documenso is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. This includes:

- Web application traffic
- API requests
- Email delivery (when supported by the receiving server)
- Webhook payloads

### Encryption at Rest

For Documenso Cloud:

- Database contents are encrypted at rest
- Document storage uses encrypted object storage
- Backups are encrypted

For self-hosted deployments, encryption at rest depends on your infrastructure configuration.

### Application-Level Encryption

Documenso encrypts sensitive data at the application level:

- Encryption keys are configured via `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY`
- Session tokens are signed using `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

## Authentication Security

### Supported Authentication Methods

| Method                        | Description                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Email and password**        | Traditional authentication with hashed passwords |
| **OAuth providers**           | Google and Microsoft authentication              |
| **Generic OIDC**              | Any OpenID Connect provider                      |
| **Team SSO**                  | SAML-based single sign-on for enterprise teams   |
| **Two-factor authentication** | TOTP-based 2FA with recovery codes               |
| **Passkeys**                  | WebAuthn-based passwordless authentication       |

### Password Requirements

- Minimum length enforced
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Password reset tokens are time-limited and single-use

### Session Security

- Sessions can be viewed and revoked from account settings
- Session tokens are rotated on authentication events
- Idle sessions expire after a configurable period

## Vulnerability Disclosure

Documenso operates a responsible disclosure process for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing:

**security@documenso.com**

Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### Response Timeline

| Stage                 | Timeline            |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Acknowledgment**    | Within 48 hours     |
| **Initial triage**    | Within 5 days       |
| **Status update**     | Within 10 days      |
| **Resolution target** | Depends on severity |

### Scope

The following are in scope for vulnerability reports:

- Documenso application code
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

The following are out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the upstream project)
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept

### Recognition

We acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. With your permission, we will credit you when the fix is released.

<Callout type="warn">
  Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until they have been addressed. Public disclosure of
  unpatched vulnerabilities puts users at risk.
</Callout>

## Security Updates

### Notification

Security updates are announced through:

- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/releases)
- [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/security/advisories)

### Update Policy

- Critical vulnerabilities are patched as quickly as possible
- Security patches are backported to supported versions when feasible
- Release notes include security-related changes

### Staying Updated

For self-hosted deployments:

1. Watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/documenso/documenso) for releases
2. Subscribe to security advisories
3. Apply updates promptly, especially security patches

See [Upgrades](/docs/self-hosting/maintenance/upgrades) for update procedures.

## Self-Hosted Security Considerations

When self-hosting Documenso, you are responsible for the security of your deployment. The following recommendations apply:

### Infrastructure

- **Use HTTPS**: Configure TLS certificates for all traffic
- **Firewall rules**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **Network isolation**: Place the database on a private network
- **Regular updates**: Keep the host OS and dependencies updated

### Configuration

- **Strong secrets**: Generate cryptographically random values for:
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY`
- **Database security**: Use strong passwords and restrict database access
- **Environment variables**: Store secrets securely (do not commit to version control)

### Operations

- **Backups**: Implement regular encrypted backups
- **Monitoring**: Set up logging and alerting for security events
- **Access control**: Limit who has access to the server and database
- **Incident response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents

### Signing Certificates

- Store signing certificates securely
- Use hardware security modules (HSM) for high-security requirements
- Rotate certificates according to your security policy

See [Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/configuration/environment) for security-related configuration options.
