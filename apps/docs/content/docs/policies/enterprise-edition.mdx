## When You Need Enterprise

The Enterprise Edition is required when you:

- **Build proprietary products**: Integrate Documenso into commercial software without releasing source code
- **Offer SaaS with modifications**: Provide document signing as part of your platform with custom modifications you want to keep private
- **Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0**: Corporate policies or legal requirements prohibit use of AGPL-licensed software
- **Need to keep modifications private**: Any changes to Documenso source code that you don't want to disclose

<Callout type="info">
  If you run Documenso without modifications, or your modifications are open source under AGPL-3.0,
  the Community Edition is sufficient.
</Callout>
