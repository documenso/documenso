The Enterprise Edition is a commercial license for Documenso that removes the AGPL-3.0 source code disclosure requirements. It allows organizations to use, modify, and integrate Documenso into proprietary products without open-source obligations.

## When You Need Enterprise

The Enterprise Edition is required when you:

- **Build proprietary products**: Integrate Documenso into commercial software without releasing source code
- **Offer SaaS with modifications**: Provide document signing as part of your platform with custom modifications you want to keep private
- **Cannot comply with AGPL-3.0**: Corporate policies or legal requirements prohibit use of AGPL-licensed software
- **Need to keep modifications private**: Any changes to Documenso source code that you don't want to disclose

<Callout type="info">
  If you run Documenso without modifications, or your modifications are open source under AGPL-3.0,
  the Community Edition is sufficient.
</Callout>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch from Community to Enterprise?

Yes. Your existing deployment can transition to the Enterprise license. Contact sales@documenso.com to discuss migration.

### Does the Enterprise license include Documenso Cloud?

The license and cloud service are separate. Enterprise cloud plans include both the commercial license and hosted service. Self-hosted Enterprise licenses cover only the license rights.

### What happens if I don't renew?

If you don't renew, you lose access to support and updates. Depending on your agreement terms, you may continue using the last licensed version or need to transition to the Community Edition (with AGPL-3.0 compliance).

### Can I use Enterprise features with the Community Edition?

No. Enterprise-only features require an active Enterprise license. The Community Edition includes core document signing functionality.

### Is there a trial period?

Contact sales@documenso.com to discuss evaluation options for your organization.
