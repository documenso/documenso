## Signing Order

You can control the sequence in which recipients receive and act on a document by enabling signing order.

<Tabs items={['Parallel signing (default)', 'Sequential signing']}>
  <Tab value="Parallel signing (default)">

All recipients receive the document simultaneously and can act in any order. The document is completed when all required recipients have finished their actions.

</Tab>
  <Tab value="Sequential signing">

Recipients receive the document one at a time, in the order you specify. Each recipient must complete their action before the next recipient is notified.

To enable sequential signing:

1. When adding recipients, check the "Enable signing order" option
2. Assign an order number to each recipient
3. Recipients with the same order number can act simultaneously
4. The document proceeds to the next order number only when all recipients at the current level have completed their actions

<Callout type="info">Sequential signing is required if you want to use the Assistant role.</Callout>
