## Workflow Overview

A typical signing workflow follows these steps:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Prepare    │ ──► │     Send     │ ──► │   Notify     │
│   Document   │     │   Document   │     │  Recipients  │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
                                                 │
                                                 ▼
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Document   │ ◄── │    Seal &    │ ◄── │  Recipients  │
│  Completed   │     │   Finalize   │     │     Sign     │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

1. **Prepare** - Upload the document, add recipients, and place fields
2. **Send** - Distribute the document to recipients
3. **Notify** - Recipients receive signing requests
4. **Sign** - Recipients complete their assigned fields
5. **Complete** - Document is sealed and distributed to all parties

## Step 1: Preparing the Document

Document preparation involves three main tasks: uploading, adding recipients, and placing fields.

### Upload the Document

Start by uploading a PDF document. You can:

- Upload directly from your device
- Create from an existing template
- Duplicate a previously sent document

Once uploaded, the document enters the **Draft** state where you can configure it before sending.

### Add Recipients

Add the people who need to interact with the document. Each recipient needs:

- **Email address** - Where they receive the signing request
- **Name** - Displayed in the document and audit trail
- **Role** - Determines what actions they can take

Available roles include:

| Role      | Purpose                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Signer    | Must sign the document                              |
| Approver  | Must approve (signature optional)                   |
| Viewer    | Must confirm they viewed the document               |
| Assistant | Pre-fills fields for other recipients               |
| CC        | Receives a copy after completion (no action needed) |

### Place Fields

Add fields to the document that recipients will complete. At minimum, each signer needs one signature field. You can also add:

- Name and email fields (auto-filled from recipient info)
- Date fields (auto-filled with signing date)
- Text, number, and dropdown fields for custom input
- Checkboxes and radio buttons for selections
- Initials for acknowledging specific sections

Each field is assigned to a specific recipient, indicated by color coding in the editor.

<Callout type="info">
  The document cannot be sent until every signer has at least one signature field assigned to them.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Sending for Signature

When the document is ready, you send it to recipients. You have two distribution options:

### Email Distribution

Recipients receive an email notification with a link to sign. You can customize:

- Email subject line
- Message body with personalized variables
- Reply-to address for recipient responses

### Manual Distribution

Generate signing links without sending emails. Use this when you want to:

- Send links via SMS or messaging apps
- Embed links in your own application
- Control notification timing yourself

After sending, the document moves from **Draft** to **Pending** status.

## Step 3: Recipient Notification

When you send a document via email, each recipient receives a notification containing:

- The document title
- Your name and email (or team name)
- Your custom message (or a role-specific default)
- A unique signing link

The signing link is specific to each recipient and cannot be used by others. Links remain active until the document is completed, deleted, or expired.

### Signing Order

By default, all recipients are notified simultaneously (parallel signing). If you enable sequential signing:

1. Only recipients in the first signing position receive notifications initially
2. When they complete their actions, the next group is notified
3. This continues until all recipients have been notified and completed their actions

## Step 4: Recipient Signs

When a recipient clicks their signing link, they see the document with their assigned fields highlighted. The signing experience depends on their role.

### Signer Experience

Signers must complete all required fields before they can finish. For signature fields, they can:

- **Draw** a signature using mouse or touchscreen
- **Type** their name and select a font style
- **Upload** an image of their existing signature

After completing all fields, the signer clicks a button to submit. They receive a confirmation and can download a copy of the document showing their completed fields.

### Approver Experience

Approvers review the document and must explicitly approve it. If signature fields are assigned, they can optionally sign. The document cannot proceed until all approvers have given approval.

### Viewer Experience

Viewers see the full document and must confirm they have viewed it. They cannot add signatures or modify any content.

### Authentication

You can require recipients to verify their identity before signing through:

- Email verification (confirm access to the email address)
- Access code (enter a code you provide separately)
- Passkey (authenticate with a hardware or software passkey)

## Step 5: Document Completion

Once all recipients with required actions have completed them, the document is finalized.

### Sealing

The completed document is sealed with a digital certificate that:

- Cryptographically signs the PDF
- Prevents modification without detection
- Provides proof of authenticity

### Audit Trail

An audit log is generated and can be attached to the document. The audit trail records:

- When the document was created and sent
- When each recipient viewed and signed
- IP addresses and timestamps for each action
- Any authentication methods used

### Distribution

All parties receive the completed document:

- Signers, approvers, and viewers receive their copy via email
- CC recipients receive their first notification with the completed document
- The document owner can download the signed PDF from their dashboard

## Workflow Variations

Documenso supports several workflow variations to handle different signing scenarios.

### Sequential Signing

When recipients must sign in a specific order, enable signing order:

1. Assign each recipient a signing position (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. Recipients at position 1 sign first
3. Recipients at position 2 are notified only after position 1 completes
4. Multiple recipients can share the same position to sign in parallel within that step

Use sequential signing when:

- Later signers need to see what earlier signers entered
- Approval must happen before final signatures
- Company policy requires a specific signing order

### Approval Workflows

Combine approver and signer roles to create approval workflows:

1. Add approvers at signing position 1
2. Add signers at signing position 2
3. Approvers review and approve first
4. Signers are notified only after approval is complete

If an approver rejects the document (when rejection is enabled), the workflow stops and signers are never notified.

### Assistants for Pre-filling

Use assistants to have one person prepare the document for another:

1. Add an assistant at signing position 1
2. Add the final signer at signing position 2
3. The assistant pre-fills fields with suggested values
4. The signer reviews and completes their signature

This is useful when administrative staff prepare documents for executives or when gathering information from one person while another signs.

<Callout type="info">
  The Assistant role is only available when sequential signing is enabled.
</Callout>

### Direct Links

For high-volume signing scenarios, you can create direct links that allow anyone to sign without receiving an individual invitation:

- Generate a public signing link for a document or template
- Share the link on your website, in emails, or through other channels
- Each person who accesses the link creates their own signing instance
- Useful for waivers, consent forms, and public agreements
