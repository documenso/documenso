Fields validate input based on their type and configuration:

- **Read-only fields** display pre-filled values that cannot be modified
- **Number fields** validate against minimum and maximum values when configured
- **Checkbox fields** can enforce a minimum or maximum number of selections

If validation fails, the recipient sees an error message and must correct the input before proceeding.
