## Team Email

Adding a team email address enables several capabilities:

- **Team Inbox** - View signing requests sent to this email address
- **Send on behalf of the team** - Documents sent from the team appear to come from the team email rather than your personal email
- **Track team documents** - See documents sent from this email in the team's document list
- **Consistent branding** - Recipients see the team identity rather than individual sender details

To configure a team email:

1. Go to **Team Settings** > **General**
2. Enter the email address in the **Team Email** field
3. Click **Update** to save

<Callout type="info">
  The team email is used as the sender identity for documents sent from the team. Recipients will
