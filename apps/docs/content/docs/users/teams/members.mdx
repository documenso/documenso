Teams allow you to collaborate with others in your organization. This page covers team member roles, adding and removing members, and managing access.

## Team member roles

Teams have three roles with different permission levels:

| Role        | Permissions                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin**   | Full access to team settings, can manage all members, delete the team, and control document visibility |
| **Manager** | Can manage team members (at or below their role level) and access manager-level documents              |
| **Member**  | Can access team documents shared with all members                                                      |

### Role hierarchy

Higher roles can manage users at or below their level:

- Admins can add, update, or remove Admins, Managers, and Members
- Managers can add, update, or remove Managers and Members
- Members cannot manage other team members

## Adding team members

Before adding someone to a team, they must first be a member of your organization.

### Add existing organization members

1. Go to your team settings
2. Click **Add members**
3. Select organization members from the list
4. Click **Next**
5. Assign a team role to each member
6. Click **Add Members**

<Callout type="info">
  If you can't find someone in the member list, they need to be invited to your organization first.
  You can do this directly from the team member dialog.
</Callout>

### Invite new organization members

If the person you want to add isn't in your organization yet:

1. In the **Add members** dialog, click **Invite them to the organisation first**
2. Enter their email address and organization role
3. Click **Send invite**
4. Once they accept, return to add them to the team

## Accepting invitations

When someone invites you to an organization:

1. Check your email for the invitation
2. Click the link in the email
3. Sign in or create a Documenso account
4. Accept the invitation

After joining the organization, a team admin or manager can add you to specific teams.

## Changing member roles

To change a team member's role:

1. Go to your team settings
2. Find the member in the list
3. Click the actions menu (three dots)
4. Select **Update role**
5. Choose the new role
6. Click **Update**

<Callout type="warn">
  You can only change roles for members at or below your own role level. For example, managers
  cannot change an admin's role.
</Callout>

## Removing members

To remove someone from a team:

1. Go to your team settings
2. Find the member in the list
3. Click the actions menu (three dots)
4. Select **Remove from team**
5. Confirm the removal

Removing someone from a team doesn't remove them from the organization. They can be re-added to the team later.

## Member limits

The number of members you can have depends on your plan:

- **Free plans** have limited team members
- **Paid plans** include a set number of seats
- **Seat-based plans** charge per member

When you invite new members on a seat-based plan, your billing automatically adjusts. Check your organization's billing settings to see your current member count and limits.

## Document visibility

Team documents have visibility settings that control which roles can access them:

| Visibility            | Who can see         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Admin only**        | Only team admins    |
| **Manager and above** | Admins and managers |
| **Everyone**          | All team members    |

Admins can set default visibility for new documents in team settings.
