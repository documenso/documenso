## Organisation Roles

Organisation members have different permission levels that determine what they can do across the organisation.

| Role        | Manage Settings | Manage Teams | Manage Members | Billing | Delete Organisation |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **Owner**   | Yes             | Yes          | Yes            | Yes     | Yes                 |

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

## Team Member Roles

Teams have three roles with different permission levels:

| Role        | Permissions                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin**   | Full access to team settings, can manage all members, delete the team, and control document visibility |
| **Manager** | Can manage team members (at or below their role level) and access manager-level documents              |
| **Member**  | Can access team documents shared with all members                                                      |

### Role hierarchy

Higher roles can manage users at or below their level:

- Admins can add, update, or remove **Admins**, **Managers**, and **Members**
- Managers can add, update, or remove **Managers** and **Members**
- Members cannot manage other team members

## Adding Team Members

Before adding someone to a team, they must first be a member of your organization.

### Add existing organization members

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to your team settings and click **Add members**.</Step>
  <Step>Select organization members from the list and click **Next**.</Step>
  <Step>Assign a team role to each member, then click **Add Members**.</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  If you can't find someone in the member list, they need to be invited to your organization first.
  You can do this directly from the team member dialog.
</Callout>

### Invite new organization members

If the person you want to add isn't in your organization yet:

<Steps>
  <Step>In the **Add members** dialog, click **Invite them to the organization first**.</Step>
  <Step>Enter their email address and organization role, then click **Send invite**.</Step>
  <Step>Once they accept, return to add them to the team.</Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk invite via CSV

You can invite multiple members at once by uploading a CSV file. The CSV should have the following structure:

| Email address       | Role    |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| admin@example.com   | Admin   |
| manager@example.com | Manager |
| member@example.com  | Member  |

## Accepting Invitations

When someone invites you to an organization:

<Steps>
  <Step>Check your email for the invitation and click the link.</Step>
  <Step>Sign in or create a Documenso account.</Step>
  <Step>Accept the invitation.</Step>
</Steps>

After joining the organization, a team admin or manager can add you to specific teams.

## Changing Member Roles

To change a team member's role:

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to your team settings and find the member in the list.</Step>
  <Step>Click the actions menu (three dots) and select **Update role**.</Step>
  <Step>Choose the new role and click **Update**.</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  You can only change roles for members at or below your own role level. For example, managers
  cannot change an admin's role.
</Callout>

## Removing Members

To remove someone from a team:

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to your team settings and find the member in the list.</Step>
  <Step>Click the actions menu (three dots) and select **Remove from team**.</Step>
  <Step>Confirm the removal.</Step>
</Steps>

Removing someone from a team doesn't remove them from the organization. They can be re-added to the team later.

## Member Limits

The Teams plan includes 5 organisation members. Additional members beyond 5 are charged per seat according to your plan's pricing.

| Plan           | Included Members | Additional Members |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **Teams**      | 5                | Per-seat pricing   |
| **Enterprise** | Custom           | Per agreement      |

When you invite new members on a seat-based plan, your billing automatically adjusts. Check your organization's billing settings to see your current member count and limits.

## Document Visibility

Team documents have visibility settings that control which roles can access them:

| Visibility            | Who can see         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Admin only**        | Only team admins    |
| **Manager and above** | Admins and managers |
| **Everyone**          | All team members    |

Admins can set default visibility for new documents in team settings.
