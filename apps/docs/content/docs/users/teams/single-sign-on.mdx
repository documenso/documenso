<Callout type="warn">SSO is only available on the Enterprise plan.</Callout>

## Supported Providers

Documenso supports any identity provider that implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Common providers include:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Google Workspace
- Okta
- Auth0
- OneLogin
- JumpCloud

## Setting Up SSO

<Callout type="info">You must be an organization admin or manager to configure SSO.</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access SSO Settings

1. Navigate to your organization settings
2. Select **Single Sign-On** from the sidebar

![SSO settings page](/organisations/organisations-sso-settings.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Get Your Redirect URI

At the top of the SSO settings page, you'll find the **Redirect URI** and **Required Scopes**. Copy these values - you'll need them when configuring your identity provider.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Your Identity Provider

In your identity provider's admin console, create a new OIDC application with:

- **Redirect URI**: The value from the Documenso SSO settings page
- **Scopes**: `openid`, `email`, `profile`

After creating the application, note down:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- OpenID Connect discovery URL (also called "well-known" URL)

</Step>

<Step>
### Enter SSO Configuration

Back in Documenso, enter the following:

- **Issuer URL**: Your provider's OpenID Connect discovery endpoint
- **Client ID**: The application client ID from your provider
- **Client Secret**: The application secret from your provider

</Step>

<Step>
### Set Allowed Domains and Default Role

Configure which email domains can authenticate and what role new users receive (see sections below).

</Step>

<Step>
### Enable SSO

Toggle **Enable SSO portal** and click **Update** to activate SSO for your team.

</Step>
</Steps>

## SSO Configuration Settings

### Issuer URL

The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint for your identity provider. Common formats:

| Provider           | Issuer URL Format                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Workspace   | `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                        |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Okta               | `https://{your-domain}.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                     |
| Auth0              | `https://{your-domain}.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                    |

### Client Credentials

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your OIDC application
- **Client Secret**: The secret key used to authenticate your application

<Callout type="warn">
  Store your client secret securely. If compromised, regenerate it immediately in your identity
  provider.
</Callout>

### Default Organization Role

The role assigned to users when they first sign in through SSO. Choose from:

- **Member**: Can view and sign documents shared with them
- **Manager**: Can manage documents and organization settings
- **Admin**: Full access to organization configuration

You can change individual user roles after they've joined.

### Allowed Email Domains

Restrict which email domains can authenticate through your SSO portal. Enter domains separated by spaces:

```
example.com subsidiary.example.com
```

Leave empty to allow any domain authenticated by your identity provider.

<Callout type="warn">
  Without domain restrictions, anyone who can authenticate with your identity provider can join your
  team.
</Callout>

## User Provisioning

When a user signs in through your SSO portal for the first time:

1. Documenso verifies their identity with your provider
2. A new account is created (or linked if the email already exists)
3. The user is added to your organization with the default role
4. They can immediately access organization documents

Users provisioned through SSO:

- Cannot change their email address
- Cannot set a Documenso password (they must use SSO)
- Are removed from SSO access if removed from your identity provider

## SSO-Only Enforcement

Once SSO is enabled, you can share your organization's SSO portal URL with members. The portal URL is displayed at the top of the SSO settings page.

To enforce SSO-only authentication:

1. Share only the SSO portal URL with organization members
2. Restrict allowed email domains to your organization
3. Remove any organization members who signed up with passwords

<Callout type="info">
  Users who joined before SSO was enabled can still sign in with their original method. To enforce
  SSO for existing users, remove and re-invite them through the SSO portal.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid issuer URL

- Verify the URL is correct and publicly accessible
- Ensure the URL points to an OpenID Connect discovery document
- Check that the URL includes the full path (usually ending in `/.well-known/openid-configuration`)

### Client authentication failed

- Verify the client ID and secret match your identity provider exactly
- Check that the OIDC application hasn't been deleted or disabled
- Regenerate the client secret if you suspect it's incorrect

### Redirect URI mismatch

- Copy the redirect URI exactly from Documenso's SSO settings
- Check for trailing slashes - they must match exactly
- Ensure you're using HTTPS

### User not provisioned

- Verify the user's email domain is in the allowed domains list
- Check that the user exists in your identity provider
- Ensure the user's account in your identity provider has an email address

### User already exists

If a user already has a Documenso account with the same email:

- Their existing account will be linked to your team
- They can sign in through your SSO portal going forward

## Testing Your SSO Portal

After configuring SSO, verify it works correctly:

1. Navigate to your portal URL (found at the top of the organisation SSO settings page)
2. Sign in with a test account from your configured domain
3. Verify the user is provisioned with the correct organisation role

### Custom Subdomain

To reduce friction for your users, create a custom subdomain that redirects to your SSO portal link. For example, `documenso.your-organisation.com` can redirect to the portal URL shown in your SSO settings.
