<Callout type="warn">SSO is only available on the Enterprise plan.</Callout>

## Supported Providers

Documenso supports any identity provider that implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. Common providers include:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Google Workspace
- Okta
- Auth0
- OneLogin
- JumpCloud

## Setting Up SSO

<Callout type="info">You must be an organization admin or manager to configure SSO.</Callout>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Access SSO settings

1. Navigate to your organization settings
2. Select **Single Sign-On** from the sidebar

![SSO settings page](/organisations/organisations-sso-settings.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Get your redirect URI

At the top of the SSO settings page, you'll find the **Redirect URI** and **Required Scopes**. Copy these values - you'll need them when configuring your identity provider.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure your identity provider

In your identity provider's admin console, create a new OIDC application with:

- **Redirect URI**: The value from the Documenso SSO settings page
- **Scopes**: `openid`, `email`, `profile`

After creating the application, note down:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- OpenID Connect discovery URL (also called "well-known" URL)

</Step>

<Step>
### Enter SSO configuration

Back in Documenso, enter the following:

- **Issuer URL**: Your provider's OpenID Connect discovery endpoint
- **Client ID**: The application client ID from your provider
- **Client Secret**: The application secret from your provider

</Step>

<Step>
### Set allowed domains and default role

Configure which email domains can authenticate and what role new users receive (see sections below).

</Step>

<Step>
### Enable SSO

Toggle **Enable SSO portal** and click **Update** to activate SSO for your team.

</Step>
</Steps>

## SSO Configuration Settings

### Issuer URL

The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint for your identity provider.

| Provider           | Issuer URL Format                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Workspace   | `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                        |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Okta               | `https://{your-domain}.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                     |
| Auth0              | `https://{your-domain}.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`                    |

### Client Credentials

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your OIDC application
- **Client Secret**: The secret key used to authenticate your application

<Callout type="warn">
  Store your client secret securely. If compromised, regenerate it immediately in your identity
  provider.
</Callout>

### Default Organization Role

The role assigned to users when they first sign in through SSO. You can change individual roles after they've joined.

<Tabs items={['Member', 'Manager', 'Admin']}>
  <Tab value="Member">Can view and sign documents shared with them.</Tab>
  <Tab value="Manager">Can manage documents and organization settings.</Tab>
  <Tab value="Admin">Full access to organization configuration.</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Allowed Email Domains

Restrict which email domains can authenticate through your SSO portal. Enter domains separated by spaces:

```
example.com subsidiary.example.com
```

Leave empty to allow any domain authenticated by your identity provider.

<Callout type="warn">
  Without domain restrictions, anyone who can authenticate with your identity provider can join your
  team.
</Callout>

## User Provisioning

When a user signs in through your SSO portal for the first time:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Verify identity

Documenso verifies their identity with your provider.

</Step>
<Step>
### Create or link account

A new account is created, or linked if the email already exists.

</Step>
<Step>
### Add to organization

The user is added to your organization with the default role.

</Step>
<Step>
### Grant access

They can immediately access organization documents.

</Step>
</Steps>

Users provisioned through SSO:

- Cannot change their email address
- Cannot set a Documenso password (they must use SSO)
- Are removed from SSO access if removed from your identity provider

## SSO-Only Enforcement

Once SSO is enabled, you can share your organization's SSO portal URL with members (displayed at the top of the SSO settings page). To enforce SSO-only authentication:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Share portal URL only

Share only the SSO portal URL with organization members (not the main Documenso login).

</Step>
<Step>
### Restrict domains

Restrict allowed email domains to your organization.

</Step>
<Step>
### Remove password users

Remove any organization members who signed up with passwords, then re-invite them through the SSO portal.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Users who joined before SSO was enabled can still sign in with their original method. To enforce
  SSO for existing users, remove and re-invite them through the SSO portal.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Invalid issuer URL">
    - Verify the URL is correct and publicly accessible
    
    - Ensure the URL points to an OpenID Connect discovery document
    
    - Check that the URL includes the full path (usually ending in `/.well-known/openid-configuration`)
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Client authentication failed">
  - Verify the client ID and secret match your identity provider exactly - Check that the OIDC
  application hasn't been deleted or disabled. - Regenerate the client secret if you suspect it's
  incorrect.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Redirect URI mismatch">
  - Copy the redirect URI exactly from Documenso's SSO settings - Check for trailing slashes. They
  must match exactly. - Ensure you're using HTTPS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User not provisioned">
  - Verify the user's email domain is in the allowed domains list - Check that the user exists in
  your identity provider - Ensure the user's account in your identity provider has an email address
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User already exists">
    If a user already has a Documenso account with the same email, their existing account will be linked to your team and they can sign in through your SSO portal going forward.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Testing Your SSO Portal

After configuring SSO, verify it works correctly:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Open portal

Navigate to your portal URL (found at the top of the organisation SSO settings page).

</Step>
<Step>
### Sign in

Sign in with a test account from your configured domain.

</Step>
<Step>
### Verify provisioning

Verify the user is provisioned with the correct organisation role.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Custom Subdomain

To reduce friction for your users, create a custom subdomain that redirects to your SSO portal link. For example, `documenso.your-organisation.com` can redirect to the portal URL shown in your SSO settings.
