## What are Organisations?

Organisations are the top-level entity in Documenso's hierarchy. Each organisation can contain multiple teams, and each team can have multiple members.

This structure provides:

- **Centralized Management** - Control multiple teams from a single organisational dashboard
- **Unified Billing** - Manage billing and subscriptions at the organisation level
- **Access Control** - Define roles and groups across the entire organisation
- **Group Management** - Create custom groups to organise members and control team access
- **Global Settings** - Apply consistent settings across all teams in your organisation

</Steps>

Once created, you can create teams to organise your work. Each team operates independently but inherits organisation-level settings and branding.

## Organisation vs Team Settings

Teams inherit settings from their parent organisation by default. You can override these at the team level:

| Setting                  | Organisation Level         | Team Level              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Branding**             | Sets default for all teams | Can override or inherit |
| **Document Preferences** | Sets default for all teams | Can override or inherit |
| **Email Preferences**    | Sets default for all teams | Can override or inherit |
| **Document Visibility**  | Sets default for all teams | Can override or inherit |
| **Billing**              | Managed centrally          | Not applicable          |
| **SSO**                  | Configured centrally       | Not applicable          |
| **Members**              | Managed at org level       | Assigned per team       |

## Best Practices

1. **Use groups effectively** - Leverage groups to simplify permission management across teams
2. **Set organisation-wide defaults** - Configure document preferences, branding, and email settings at the organisation level for consistency
3. **Assign roles carefully** - Organisation Admins and Managers automatically receive Team Admin access to all teams
