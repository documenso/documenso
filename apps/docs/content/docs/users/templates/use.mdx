Templates let you quickly create documents with pre-configured recipients, fields, and settings. When you use a template, you fill in the recipient details and optionally send the document immediately.

## Create a document from a template

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open the template

Navigate to **Templates** in the sidebar and find the template you want to use. Click on the template to open its detail page, or click the three-dot menu and select **Use Template**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Click Use Template

From the template detail page, click the **Use Template** button. A dialog opens where you configure the document.

</Step>

<Step>
### Fill in recipient details

For each recipient defined in the template, enter their:

- **Email** (required) - The recipient's email address
- **Name** (optional) - The recipient's display name

If the template has pre-filled recipient information, those fields appear with the existing values. You can modify them or leave them as-is.

</Step>

<Step>
### Choose how to create the document

You have two options:

- **Create as draft** - Creates the document without sending. You can review and edit it before sending.
- **Create and send** - Creates the document and immediately sends it to recipients.

Check the **Send document** checkbox to send immediately, or leave it unchecked to create a draft.

</Step>

<Step>
### Click Create

Click **Create as draft** or **Create and send** depending on your selection. You're redirected to the new document.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Upload a custom document

You can replace the template's PDF with a different document when creating from a template. This keeps all the field positions and recipient settings but uses your uploaded file.

1. In the Use Template dialog, check **Upload custom document**
2. Click **Upload** next to each document you want to replace
3. Select a PDF file from your computer
4. Complete the rest of the form and create the document

<Callout type="info">
  The uploaded document must be a PDF. Field positions are preserved from the template, so the new
  document should have a similar layout.
</Callout>

## Sequential signing

If the template uses sequential signing, recipients receive the document in order. The signing order displays next to each recipient in the dialog and cannot be changed when using the template.

To modify the signing order, edit the template itself before creating documents from it.

## Distribution methods

How recipients receive the document depends on the template's distribution method:

| Distribution method | What happens                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email**           | Recipients receive an email with a link to sign             |
| **None**            | No emails sent. You receive signing links to share manually |

When using a template with no email distribution and selecting **Create as pending**, you're redirected to the document page where signing links are displayed for you to copy and share.

## Template vs document differences

When you create a document from a template, the document becomes independent. Changes you make to the document don't affect the template, and changes to the template don't affect existing documents.

| What you can change | Template | Document created from template   |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Recipients          | Yes      | Yes (before sending)             |
| Fields              | Yes      | Yes (before sending)             |
| PDF content         | Yes      | Only at creation (custom upload) |
| Settings            | Yes      | Yes (before sending)             |

Documents created from a template are tracked on the template's detail page under **Documents created from template**.

## Bulk send

To create multiple documents from one template with different recipients, use bulk send:

1. Go to the template detail page or templates list
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Bulk send**
3. Upload a CSV file with recipient information
4. Each row creates a separate document

This is useful for sending the same document to many people, such as offer letters or agreements.
