Templates are reusable document configurations that save you from recreating the same setup every time you send a similar document. A template stores your PDF, recipient roles, field placements, and settings so you can generate new documents with a few clicks.

Use templates when you:

- Send the same type of document regularly (contracts, NDAs, onboarding forms)
- Need consistent field placement across documents
- Want to pre-configure recipients and signing workflows
- Plan to use [direct links](/docs/users/documents/direct-links) for public signing

## Create a Template from Scratch

<Steps>
<Step>
### Go to Templates

Navigate to **Templates** in the sidebar and click **Upload Template**.

![Templates page](/templates/documenso-template-page.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Upload your document

Select one or more PDF files to upload. If you select multiple files, they're combined into a single template.

After uploading, you'll enter the template editor where you can configure recipients, fields, and settings.

![Template with uploaded document](/templates/documenso-template-page-uploaded-document.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Add recipients

Add the people who will interact with documents created from this template. For each recipient, specify:

- **Email** - Use a real email if the recipient is always the same person, or a placeholder email (like `client@placeholder.com`) if it changes each time
- **Name** - Optional, but helps identify recipients
- **Role** - What the recipient needs to do (Signer, Approver, Viewer, CC)

![Template recipients](/templates/documenso-template-recipients.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Add fields

Drag fields from the field palette onto your document and assign them to recipients. At minimum, each Signer needs one Signature field.

See [Add Fields](/docs/users/documents/add-fields) for detailed guidance on field types and configuration.

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the template

Click **Save Template** to finish. Your template appears in the Templates list, ready to use.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Convert a Document to a Template

If you've already set up a document with recipients and fields, you can save it as a template instead of starting over.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open the document

Go to **Documents** and find the draft document you want to convert. Click to open it in the editor.

<Callout type="info">
  You can only convert draft documents to templates. Documents that have already been sent cannot be
  converted.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Convert to template

Click the three-dot menu in the document editor and select **Convert to template**.

The document, recipients, and all field placements are copied to a new template.

</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Placeholder Recipients

Templates often need placeholder recipients - people whose actual email addresses you won't know until you use the template. For example, a sales contract template might have:

- **You** (your real email) - Always signs as the company representative
- **Client** (placeholder) - Different person for each contract

### Setting up placeholders

Use any email format that's clearly a placeholder:

- `client@placeholder.com`
- `signer1@example.com`
- `recipient@documenso.com`

When you [use the template](/docs/users/templates/use-template), you'll replace these placeholders with actual recipient emails.

### When to use real emails

Use real email addresses when the recipient is always the same person:

- Your own email for documents you always sign
- A team member who reviews all contracts
- A compliance officer who needs to approve every agreement

---

## Template Settings

Click the settings icon in the template editor to configure these options:

### Title

The template name shown in your Templates list. Use a descriptive name like "Standard NDA" or "Freelance Contract - Hourly" so you can find it quickly.

The title also becomes the default document name when you create documents from the template. Recipients see this name in their signing invitation.

### External ID

An optional identifier for integrating with external systems. Use this to:

- Match templates to records in your CRM or contract management system
- Track which template generated a document in your analytics
- Reference templates in API calls

The external ID has no effect on document signing - it's purely for your reference.

### Global settings

Additional options that apply to all documents created from this template:

| Setting      | Description                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date format  | How dates appear in Date fields (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY) |
| Time zone    | Time zone used for date calculations                             |
| Redirect URL | Where to send recipients after they finish signing               |
| Language     | Language for the signing interface and emails                    |

## Template Visibility

Templates can be personal (visible only to you) or shared with your team.

### Personal templates

By default, templates you create are personal. Only you can see, edit, and use them.

### Team templates

If you're part of a team, you can create templates that all team members can use:

1. Switch to your team workspace using the workspace selector
2. Create the template while in the team context
3. All team members with appropriate permissions can now use this template

Team templates are useful for:

- Standardizing documents across your organization
- Sharing common contracts with your sales team
- Ensuring consistent field placement and settings

<Callout type="info">
  Team templates require a team workspace. See [Teams](/docs/users/teams) to learn about creating
  and managing teams.
</Callout>

### Moving templates between personal and team

You cannot directly move a template from personal to team or vice versa. Instead:

1. Use the template to create a document
2. Convert that document to a new template in the desired workspace

---

## Edit a Template

To modify an existing template:

1. Go to **Templates** and find the template you want to edit
2. Click on the template to open it in the editor
3. Make your changes to recipients, fields, or settings
4. Click **Save Template**

Changes only affect future documents created from the template. Documents already created from this template are not updated.

---

## Duplicate a Template

To create a copy of an existing template:

1. Go to **Templates** and find the template
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Duplicate**
3. The copy opens in the editor where you can make changes
4. Save with a new name

This is useful when you need a variation of an existing template without modifying the original.

---

## Delete a Template

To delete a template:

1. Go to **Templates** and find the template
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Callout type="warn">
  Deleting a template is permanent. Documents already created from the template are not affected,
  but you won't be able to create new documents from it.
</Callout>

---

## Next Steps

Now that you have a template:

![Using a template](/templates/documenso-use-template.webp)

- [Use a Template](/docs/users/templates/use-template) - Create documents from your template
- [Direct Links](/docs/users/documents/direct-links) - Share a signing link without knowing recipient emails
- [API: Templates](/docs/developers/api/templates) - Create and use templates programmatically
