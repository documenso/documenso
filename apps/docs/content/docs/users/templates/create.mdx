## Overview

Templates are reusable document configurations that save you from recreating the same setup every time you send a similar document. A template stores your PDF, recipient roles, field placements, and settings so you can generate new documents with a few clicks.

Use templates when you:

- Send the same type of document regularly (contracts, NDAs, onboarding forms)
- Need consistent field placement across documents
- Want to pre-configure recipients and signing workflows
- Plan to use [direct links](/docs/users/documents/direct-links) for public signing

## Create a Template from Scratch

<Steps>
<Step>
### Go to templates

Navigate to **Templates** in the sidebar and click **Upload Template**.

![Templates page](/templates/documenso-template-page.webp)

</Step>

<Step>
### Upload your document

Select one or more PDF files to upload. If you select multiple files, they're combined into a single template.

After uploading, you'll enter the template editor where you can configure recipients, fields, and settings.

</Step>

<Step>
### Add recipients

Add the people who will interact with documents created from this template. For each recipient, specify:

- **Email**: Use a real email if the recipient is always the same person, or a placeholder email (like `client@placeholder.com`) if it changes each time
- **Name**: Optional, but helps identify recipients
- **Role**: What the recipient needs to do (Signer, Approver, Viewer, CC)

</Step>

<Step>
### Add fields

Drag fields from the field palette onto your document and assign them to recipients. At minimum, each signer needs one signature field.

See [Add Fields](/docs/users/documents/add-fields) for detailed guidance on field types and configuration.

</Step>

<Step>
### Save the template

Click **Save Template** to finish. Your template appears in the Templates list, ready to use.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Placeholder Recipients

Templates often need placeholder recipients - people whose actual email addresses you won't know until you use the template. For example, a sales contract template might have:

- **You** (your real email) - Always signs as the company representative
- **Client** (placeholder) - Different person for each contract

### Setting up placeholders

Use any email format that's clearly a placeholder:

- `client@placeholder.com`
- `signer1@example.com`
- `recipient@documenso.com`

When you [use the template](/docs/users/templates/use), you'll replace these placeholders with actual recipient emails.

### When to use real emails

Use real email addresses when the recipient is always the same person:

- Your own email for documents you always sign
- A team member who reviews all contracts
- A compliance officer who needs to approve every agreement

## Template Settings

Click the settings icon in the template editor to configure these options:

### Title

The template name shown in your Templates list. Use a descriptive name like "Standard NDA" or "Freelance Contract - Hourly" so you can find it quickly.

The title also becomes the default document name when you create documents from the template. Recipients see this name in their signing invitation.

### External ID

An optional identifier for integrating with external systems. Use this to:

- Match templates to records in your CRM or contract management system
- Track which template generated a document in your analytics
- Reference templates in API calls

The external ID has no effect on document signing - it's purely for your reference.

### Global settings

Additional options that apply to all documents created from this template:

| Setting      | Description                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date format  | How dates appear in Date fields (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY) |
| Time zone    | Time zone used for date calculations                             |
| Redirect URL | Where to send recipients after they finish signing               |
| Language     | Language for the signing interface and emails                    |

## Template Visibility

All templates are created in a team context. Team members can see, edit, delete, and use the templates in that team. See [Teams](/docs/users/teams) to learn about creating and managing teams.

## Edit a Template

To modify an existing template:

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to **Templates** and find the template you want to edit.</Step>
  <Step>Click on the template to open it in the editor.</Step>
  <Step>Make your changes to recipients, fields, or settings.</Step>
  <Step>Click **Save Template**.</Step>
</Steps>

Changes only affect future documents created from the template. Documents already created from this template are not updated.

## Duplicate a Template

To create a copy of an existing template:

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to **Templates** and find the template.</Step>
  <Step>Click the three-dot menu and select **Duplicate**.</Step>
  <Step>The copy opens in the editor; make any changes and save with a new name.</Step>
</Steps>

This is useful when you need a variation of an existing template without modifying the original.

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to **Templates** and find the template.</Step>
