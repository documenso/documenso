## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) and passkeys are used for high-security and high-compliance signatures in addition to account login.

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security by requiring a code from an authenticator app when you sign in or sign documents.

### Enable 2FA

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open the 2FA Setup

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Find the **Two factor authentication** section
3. Click **Enable 2FA**

</Step>

<Step>
### Scan the QR Code

1. Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
2. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
3. If you cannot scan, click to reveal the setup key and enter it manually

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify and Confirm

1. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
2. Click **Enable**
3. Save your recovery codes (see [Recovery Codes](#recovery-codes) below)

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with Google does not require a 2FA code. As an authentication provider, your Google
  account is considered secure (e.g. you can configure 2FA on your Google account separately).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with a passkey does not require a 2FA code. Passkeys are considered two-factor by
  design — the passkey itself is the first factor, and access to the device that holds it is the
  second factor.
</Callout>

### Disable 2FA

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **Disable 2FA**
3. Enter a code from your authenticator app to confirm
4. Click **Disable**

## Recovery Codes

Recovery codes let you access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app. When you enable 2FA, Documenso generates a set of backup codes.

### View Recovery Codes

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **View Codes** in the Recovery codes section
3. Enter a code from your authenticator app
4. Your recovery codes are displayed

### Store Recovery Codes Safely

- Click **Download** to save them as a text file
- Store them in a secure location (password manager, safe, etc.)
- Each code can only be used once

<Callout type="warn">
  If you lose both your authenticator app and your recovery codes, you will be locked out of your
  account. Store your recovery codes securely.
</Callout>

## Passkeys

Passkeys provide passwordless authentication using biometrics, hardware security keys, or password managers. You can use passkeys to sign in to Documenso and to authenticate when signing documents.

![Passkeys management page](/get-started-images/documenso-passkeys-page.webp)

### Add a Passkey

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **Manage passkeys**
3. Click **Add passkey**
4. Enter a name for the passkey (e.g., "MacBook Touch ID", "YubiKey")
5. Follow your browser's prompts to complete registration

![Add passkey dialog](/get-started-images/documenso-add-passkey-box.webp)

### Manage Passkeys

From the passkeys page, you can:

- **Rename** a passkey by clicking the edit button
- **Delete** a passkey by clicking the delete button

<Callout type="info">
  Passkeys are device-specific. If you use multiple devices, add a passkey on each one.
</Callout>

## Active Sessions

View and manage all devices currently logged into your account.

### View Sessions

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **Manage sessions**

The sessions table shows:

- **Device**: Browser and operating system
- **IP Address**: The IP address of the session
- **Last Active**: When the session was last used
- **Created**: When the session started

Your current session is marked with a "Current" badge.

### Revoke a Session

To log out a specific device:

1. Find the session in the list
2. Click **Revoke**

To log out all other devices:

1. Click **Log out all** at the top of the page
2. Confirm the action

This keeps your current session active but terminates all others.

## Security Activity

Monitor recent security-related events on your account.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **View activity**

The activity log shows events like:

- Sign-in attempts
- Password changes
- 2FA changes
- Session changes

## Linked Accounts

View and manage login methods connected to your account (Google, email/password, etc.).

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**
2. Click **Manage linked accounts**

To remove a login method:

1. Find the provider in the list
2. Click **Unlink**
3. Confirm the action

<Callout type="warn">
  Ensure you have at least one login method available before unlinking an account.
</Callout>

## API Tokens

API tokens allow external applications to access your Documenso account programmatically.

For instructions on creating and managing API tokens, see the [Authentication](/docs/developers/getting-started/authentication) guide in the developer documentation.

## Delete Your Account

Account deletion permanently removes all your data, including documents, signatures, and settings. This action cannot be undone.

### Before Deleting

- Download any documents you need to keep
- Cancel any active subscriptions
- Disable 2FA (required before deletion)

### Delete Your Account

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile**
2. Scroll to the **Delete Account** section
3. Click **Delete Account**
4. Type your email address to confirm
5. Click **Confirm Deletion**

<Callout type="error">
  Account deletion is permanent and irreversible. All documents, signatures, and account data will
  be permanently deleted.
</Callout>

## Security Best Practices

Follow these recommendations to keep your account secure:

- **Use a strong, unique password.** Avoid reusing passwords from other services.
- **Enable two-factor authentication.** 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Store recovery codes securely.** Keep them in a password manager or other secure location.
- **Add passkeys on trusted devices.** Passkeys provide phishing-resistant authentication.
- **Review active sessions regularly.** Revoke any sessions you don't recognize.
- **Monitor security activity.** Check for unexpected sign-ins or changes.
- **Use separate API tokens per integration.** If one is compromised, revoke only that token.
- **Set expiration dates on API tokens.** Shorter lifespans reduce risk if a token is leaked.
