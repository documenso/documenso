## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) and passkeys are used for high-security and high-compliance signatures in addition to account login.

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security by requiring a code from an authenticator app when you sign in or sign documents.

![Enable two-factor authentication](/get-started-images/documenso-enable-2-factor-authentication.webp)

### Enable 2FA

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open the 2FA setup

Go to **Settings** > **Security**, find the Two factor authentication section, then click **Enable 2FA**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Scan the QR code

Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.), then scan the QR code displayed on screen. If you cannot scan, click to reveal the setup key and enter it manually.

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify and confirm

- Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
- Click **Enable**
- Save your recovery codes (see [Recovery Codes](#recovery-codes) below)

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with Google does not require a 2FA code. As an authentication provider, your Google
  account is considered secure (e.g. you can configure 2FA on your Google account separately).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with a passkey does not require a 2FA code. Passkeys are considered two-factor by
  design — the passkey itself is the first factor, and access to the device that holds it is the
  second factor.
</Callout>

### Disable 2FA

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open security settings

Navigate to **Settings** > **Security**.

</Step>

<Step>
### Disable 2FA

- Click **Disable 2FA**
- Enter a code from your authenticator app to confirm
- Click **Disable**

</Step>
</Steps>

## Recovery Codes

Recovery codes let you access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app. When you enable 2FA, Documenso generates a set of backup codes.

### View Recovery Codes

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open recovery codes

Go to **Settings** > **Security**, then click **View Codes** in the Recovery codes section.

</Step>

<Step>
### Verify and view

Enter a code from your authenticator app. Your recovery codes are displayed.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Store Recovery Codes Safely

- Click **Download** to save them as a text file
- Store them in a secure location (password manager, safe, etc.)
- Each code can only be used once

<Callout type="warn">
  If you lose both your authenticator app and your recovery codes, you will be locked out of your
  account. Store your recovery codes securely.
</Callout>

## Passkeys

Passkeys provide passwordless authentication using biometrics, hardware security keys, or password managers. You can use passkeys to sign in to Documenso and to authenticate when signing documents.

- Follow your browser's prompts to complete registration

</Step>
</Steps>
