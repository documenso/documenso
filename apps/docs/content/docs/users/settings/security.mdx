## Change Your Password

If you signed up with email and password (not Google or another provider), you can change your password at any time.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click your avatar in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open the **Security** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter your current password, new password, and confirmation, then click **Update password**.
  </Step>

<Callout type="info">
  The password change form only appears if you have a password-based account. If you signed up with
  Google or another provider, you won't see this option.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) and passkeys are used for high-security and high-compliance signatures in addition to account login.

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security by requiring a code from an authenticator app when you sign in or sign documents.

![Enable two-factor authentication](/get-started-images/documenso-enable-2-factor-authentication.webp)

### Enable 2FA

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open 2FA setup

    Go to **Settings**, open the **Security** tab, find the Two factor authentication section, and click **Enable 2FA**.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Scan the QR code

    Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.) and scan the QR code. If you can't scan, reveal the setup key and enter it manually.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify and save

    Enter the 6-digit code from your app, click **Enable**, then save your recovery codes (see [Recovery Codes](#recovery-codes) below).

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with Google does not require a 2FA code. As an authentication provider, your Google
  account is considered secure (e.g. you can configure 2FA on your Google account separately).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Logging in with a passkey does not require a 2FA code. Passkeys are considered two-factor by
  design — the passkey itself is the first factor, and access to the device that holds it is the
  second factor.
</Callout>

### Disable 2FA

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open the **Security** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Disable 2FA**, enter a code from your authenticator app, then click **Disable**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recovery Codes

Recovery codes let you access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app. When you enable 2FA, Documenso generates a set of backup codes.

### View Recovery Codes

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open the **Security** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **View Codes** in the Recovery codes section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a code from your authenticator app to view your recovery codes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Store Recovery Codes Safely

- Click **Download** to save them as a text file
- Store them in a secure location (password manager, safe, etc.)
- Each code can only be used once

<Callout type="warn">
  If you lose both your authenticator app and your recovery codes, you will be locked out of your
  account. Store your recovery codes securely.
</Callout>

## Passkeys

Passkeys provide passwordless authentication using biometrics, hardware security keys, or password managers. You can use passkeys to sign in to Documenso and to authenticate when signing documents.

![Passkeys management page](/get-started-images/documenso-passkeys-page.webp)

### Add a Passkey

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open passkeys

    Go to **Settings**, open the **Security** tab, then click **Manage passkeys**.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add and name your passkey

    Click **Add passkey**, enter a name (e.g. "MacBook Touch ID", "YubiKey"), then follow your browser's prompts to complete registration.

  </Step>
</Steps>

![Add passkey dialog](/get-started-images/documenso-add-passkey-box.webp)

### Manage Passkeys

From the passkeys page, you can:

- **Rename** a passkey by clicking the edit button
- **Delete** a passkey by clicking the delete button

<Callout type="info">
  Passkeys are device-specific. If you use multiple devices, add a passkey on each one.
</Callout>

## Active Sessions
