description: Create and manage API tokens for programmatic access to your Documenso account.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Overview

API tokens allow external applications to access your Documenso account programmatically. Tokens can be scoped to your personal account or to a specific team.

For detailed instructions on creating and managing API tokens, see the [Authentication](/docs/developers/getting-started/authentication) guide in the developer documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Use separate tokens per integration** — if one is compromised, revoke only that token
- **Set expiration dates** — shorter lifespans reduce risk if a token is leaked
- **Use the minimum required scope** — only grant access to what the integration needs
