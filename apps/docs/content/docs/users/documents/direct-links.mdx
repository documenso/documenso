## Overview

Use direct links when you:

- Need to collect signatures from people whose emails you don't have
- Want to embed signing into your website or application
- Are collecting signatures from a public audience (forms, petitions, agreements)

## Limitations

- Direct links only work with templates, not individual documents
- You cannot specify recipient details in advance - they enter their own information
- Each direct link is tied to a single recipient role in the template
- The template owner receives a notification for each completed signature

---

## Create a Direct Link

Direct links are created from templates. You'll need a template before you can generate a direct link.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
<Step>
### Go to your template

Navigate to **Templates** in the sidebar and find the template you want to share.

</Step>

<Step>
### Enable direct link

Click the three-dot menu on the template row and select **Direct link**.

In the modal that appears, click **Enable direct link** to proceed.

</Step>

<Step>
### Select the recipient

Choose which recipient in your template will use the direct link:

- **Select an existing recipient**: Pick from recipients already defined in your template
- **Create one automatically**: Documenso creates a new "Direct Link Recipient" for you

![Choose direct link recipient](/direct-links/choose-direct-link-recipient-documenso.webp)

The person who opens the direct link will fill in this recipient's fields.

<Callout type="warn">
  The direct link recipient cannot be edited or deleted while the direct link is active. Disable the
  direct link first if you need to modify this recipient.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Copy the link

After selecting a recipient, you'll see your direct link:

```
https://app.documenso.com/d/<unique-token>
```

![Document direct link](/direct-links/document-direct-link-documenso.webp)

Copy this link and share it however you need - email, website, QR code, or social media.

</Step>
</Steps>

## What Recipients See

When someone opens your direct link:

1. They see the document with all fields assigned to the direct link recipient
2. They enter their name and email address
3. They complete any required fields (signature, text, checkboxes, etc.)
4. After signing, they receive a copy of the completed document via email

If the recipient has a Documenso account with the email they entered, the document also appears in their Documents dashboard.

## Manage Direct Links

### Disable a direct link

To temporarily stop accepting signatures:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Templates** and find your template.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the three-dot menu and select **Direct link**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Toggle the direct link off.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The link URL remains the same. You can re-enable it later without generating a new link.

### Delete a direct link

To permanently remove a direct link:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Disable the direct link first (see above).
  </Step>
  <Step>

    If you enable direct links again later, you'll get a new URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add Direct Links to Your Profile

You can showcase templates with direct links on your public Documenso profile:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to **Settings** > **Public Profile**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enable your public profile if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add templates with active direct links to your profile.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Visitors to your profile page can then sign those documents directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is useful for freelancers, consultants, or businesses who want clients to easily access common agreements.

## Use Cases

### Public forms and agreements

Create a template for documents that anyone can sign:

- Liability waivers
- NDAs for event attendees
- Consent forms
- Petition signatures

Share the direct link on your website, in emails, or via QR codes at physical locations.

### Embedded signing

Add signing capabilities to your website or app by embedding the direct link:

```html
<a href="https://app.documenso.com/d/your-token">Sign our agreement</a>
```

Or redirect users to the signing page after they complete another action in your application.

### Self-service contracts

Let customers or partners initiate contracts themselves:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a template with your standard terms.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Share the direct link with customers or partners.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Recipients sign and receive their copy automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    You get notified and the signed document appears in your dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>
