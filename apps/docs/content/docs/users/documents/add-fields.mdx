## Overview

Fields are placeholders that recipients fill in when signing your document. You drag fields from the palette onto your document, position them where you want information collected, and assign them to specific recipients.

</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Each signer must have at least one Signature field assigned to them. The document cannot be sent
  without this.
</Callout>

## Assign Fields to Recipients

Fields are color-coded by recipient. To change which recipient a field belongs to:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Select the field

    Click on the field to select it.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Change the recipient

    In the field properties panel, change the **Recipient** dropdown.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Confirm the assignment

    The field color updates to match the new recipient.

  </Step>
</Steps>

When you have multiple recipients, make sure each one has the appropriate fields assigned:

- **Signers** need at least one Signature field
- **Approvers** can have fields but don't require them
- **Viewers** cannot have fields assigned
- **Assistants** can pre-fill fields for other recipients

## Position and Resize Fields

### Moving Fields

Click and drag any field to reposition it on the document. Fields snap to help with alignment.

### Resizing Fields

Click a field to select it, then drag the corner handles to resize. This is useful for:

- Making signature fields larger for handwritten signatures
- Expanding text fields to accommodate longer input
- Fitting fields into existing form areas on your PDF

### Multi-Page Documents

Navigate between pages using the page controls. Fields placed on a page stay on that page. You can place fields on any page of your document.

A typical signature block includes the following fields:

1. **Signature**: Where the recipient signs
2. **Name**: Prints their full name below
3. **Date**: Records when they signed
