## Add a recipient

<Steps>
<Step>

</Step>

<Step>

</Step>

<Step>
### Enter recipient details

Fill in the following information:

- **Email** - The recipient's email address (required)
- **Name** - The recipient's name (optional, but recommended for clarity)
- **Role** - What the recipient needs to do (see [Recipient Roles](/docs/concepts/recipient-roles))

</Step>
</Steps>

## Recipient information

### Email address

The email address is where the recipient receives their signing invitation. Make sure it's correct - once you send the document, the invitation goes to this address.

### Name

Adding a name helps recipients identify themselves when they receive the document. The name appears in:

- The signing invitation email
- The document activity log
- The completed document's signature certificate

If you leave the name blank, the email address is displayed instead.

## Assigning roles

Each recipient needs a role that determines what actions they can take:

| Role      | What they do                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Signer    | Must sign the document                          |
| Approver  | Must approve the document (signing is optional) |
| Viewer    | Must confirm they viewed the document           |
| Assistant | Pre-fills fields for other recipients           |
| CC        | Receives a copy after the document is completed |

For detailed information about each role, see [Recipient Roles](/docs/concepts/recipient-roles).

<Callout type="info">
  The Assistant role is only available when sequential signing is enabled.
</Callout>

## Multiple recipients

You can add as many recipients as you need. Click **+ Add Signer** for each additional person.

Common scenarios:

- **Two-party agreement** - Add yourself and the other party as signers
- **Contract with witness** - Add the main signer plus a viewer as witness
- **Approval workflow** - Add an approver first, then signers
- **Keep stakeholders informed** - Add CC recipients who receive the final document

## Signing order

By default, all recipients receive the document at the same time and can complete their actions in any order (parallel signing). You can change this to require recipients to act in a specific sequence.

### Parallel signing (default)

All recipients receive the document simultaneously. The document is completed when everyone finishes their required actions. Use this when:

- The order doesn't matter
- You want the fastest completion time
- Recipients are independent of each other

### Sequential signing

Recipients receive the document one at a time, in the order you specify. Each person must complete their action before the next person is notified.

To enable sequential signing:

1. Toggle on **Enable signing order** in the Recipients section
2. Set the order number for each recipient (1, 2, 3, etc.)
3. Recipients with the same number act simultaneously at that step

<Callout type="info">
  Sequential signing is required to use the Assistant role. Assistants must act before the signers
  whose fields they pre-fill.
</Callout>

**Example workflow:**

| Order | Recipient        | Role      |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1     | Admin Assistant  | Assistant |
| 2     | Department Head  | Approver  |
| 3     | Contract Party A | Signer    |
| 3     | Contract Party B | Signer    |
| -     | Legal Team       | CC        |

In this example:

1. The assistant pre-fills information
2. The department head reviews and approves
3. Both contract parties sign at the same time
4. Legal receives a copy after completion

## Editing recipients

You can modify recipient details anytime before sending the document:

- **Change email or name** - Click on the field and type the new value
- **Change role** - Select a different role from the dropdown
- **Change signing order** - Adjust the order number (if sequential signing is enabled)

<Callout type="warn">
  After sending a document, you cannot change recipients. If you need different recipients, you'll
  need to create a new document.
</Callout>

## Removing recipients

To remove a recipient, click the delete icon (trash) next to their row. This also removes any fields assigned to that recipient.

You cannot remove recipients after the document has been sent.
