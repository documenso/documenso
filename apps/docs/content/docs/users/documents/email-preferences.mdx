## Overview

Email preferences allow you to set the default settings when emailing documents to your recipients.

## Preferences

Email preferences can be set on either the organisation or team level.

By default, teams inherit the preferences from the organisation. You can override these preferences on the team level at any time.

To access the preferences, navigate to either the organisation or teams settings page and click the **Email** tab under the **Preferences** section.
