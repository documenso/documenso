# AI Recipient & Field Detection

Documenso can suggest recipients and place fields automatically using Google Vertex AI (Gemini). The feature is optional and only available when your organisation or team has **AI Features** enabled. Documents are processed securely and providers do not retain your data for training.

## Requirements

- AI Features must be enabled in **Document Preferences** for your organisation or team.
- The envelope must be in **Draft** status.
- Helpful rate limits are in place (up to 3 detection requests per minute per IP) to prevent abuse. If you see a "too many requests" message, wait a minute or two and try again.

### Enable AI features

1. **Organisation settings**:

Settings > Document Preferences > **AI Features** > Enabled.

_This applies to teams that inherit organisation defaults._

2. **Team settings**:

Team Settings > Document Preferences > **AI Features** > choose Enabled, Disabled, or Inherit.

## Detect recipients

Use this to identify who needs to sign or approve.

1. Open a draft document/template and go to the **Recipients** panel.
2. Select the **sparkle** button to start detection. If AI is enabled, uploads launched from the dashboard will open the detector automatically.

3. Wait for progress to finish, then review the suggested recipients.
4. Remove any incorrect entries, then **Add recipients** to apply them. Existing recipients and duplicates are preserved.

Notes:

- Detection is unavailable once an envelope is completed.
- You can re-run detection if you update the document; each run counts toward the rate limit.

## Detect fields

Use this to auto-place fields on the pages of a draft.

1. Open the envelope editor and switch to the **Fields** tab.
2. Select **Detect with AI**. Provide optional context (e.g., "Alice is the tenant, Bob is the landlord") to improve recipient assignment.

3. Watch the progress indicators; they update per page and total fields found.
4. Review the summary and choose **Add fields** to place them in the editor.

Notes:

- Works only for draft envelopes and teams with AI features enabled.
- Existing fields are masked during detection to avoid duplicates.
- Fields are assigned to recipients based on nearby labels and your context message; you can edit them after adding.

## Best practices

- Keep labels near the intended fields (e.g., "Tenant signature", "Buyer email").
- Provide short context when roles are ambiguous.
- Always review suggestions before sending; AI assists but does not replace final checks.
