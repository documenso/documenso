description: Use Documenso's AI helpers to detect recipients and fields in draft documents.

## Overview

Documenso can suggest recipients and place fields automatically using Google Vertex AI (Gemini). The feature is optional and only available when your organisation or team has **AI Features** enabled. Documents are processed securely and providers do not retain your data for training.

## Requirements

- AI Features must be enabled in **Document Preferences** for your organisation or team.
- The envelope must be in **Draft** status.
- Helpful rate limits are in place (up to 3 detection requests per minute per IP) to prevent abuse. If you see a "too many requests" message, wait a minute or two and try again.

### Enable AI features

<Tabs items={['Organisation Settings', 'Team Settings']}>
  <Tab value="Organisation Settings">
    1. Go to **Settings** > **Document Preferences** > **AI Features**
    2. Set to **Enabled**

    _This applies to teams that inherit organisation defaults._

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Team Settings">
    1. Go to **Team Settings** > **Document Preferences** > **AI Features**
    2. Choose **Enabled**, **Disabled**, or **Inherit**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Detect Recipients

Use this to identify who needs to sign or approve.

1. Open a draft document/template and go to the **Recipients** panel.
2. Select the **sparkle** button to start detection. If AI is enabled, uploads launched from the dashboard will open the detector automatically.

3. Wait for progress to finish, then review the suggested recipients.
4. Remove any incorrect entries, then **Add recipients** to apply them. Existing recipients and duplicates are preserved.

<Callout type="info">
  Detection is unavailable once an envelope is completed. You can re-run detection if you update the
  document; each run counts toward the rate limit.
</Callout>

## Detect Fields

Use this to auto-place fields on the pages of a draft.

1. Open the envelope editor and switch to the **Fields** tab.
2. Select **Detect with AI**.

Provide optional context (e.g., "Alice is the tenant, Bob is the landlord") to improve recipient assignment.

3. Watch the progress indicators; they update per page and total fields found.
4. Review the summary and choose **Add fields** to place them in the editor.

<Callout type="info">
  Works only for draft envelopes and teams with AI features enabled. Existing fields are masked
  during detection to avoid duplicates. Fields are assigned to recipients based on nearby labels and
  your context message; you can edit them after adding.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Keep labels near the intended fields">
    Place labels close to the intended fields (e.g. "Tenant signature", "Buyer email") to improve
    detection accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provide short context when roles are ambiguous">
    Add brief context when recipient roles are unclear to help the AI assign fields correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Always review suggestions before sending">
    AI assists but does not replace final checks. Review all suggestions before sending documents.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
