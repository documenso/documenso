## Uploading Multiple Documents

You can upload multiple PDF files at once to create a single envelope containing multiple documents. The number of files you can upload per envelope depends on your plan.

To upload multiple files:

- Select multiple PDF files when using the file picker, or
- Drag and drop multiple PDF files at once

All files in the same upload become part of the same envelope and share the same recipients and signing workflow.

<Callout type="info">
  If you need separate signing workflows for each document, upload them individually.
</Callout>

## What Happens After Upload

When you upload a document:

1. **Processing**: Documenso validates the PDF and extracts page information
2. **Draft created**: A new document is created in `Draft` status
3. **Editor opens**: You're taken to the document editor to add recipients and fields

![Document editor overview](/document-signing/editor-overview.webp)

The document remains in `Draft` status until you send it. You can close the editor and return later - draft documents are saved automatically.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="File is larger than 50MB">
    Reduce the file size before uploading:

    - Compress images within the PDF
    - Remove unnecessary pages
    - Use a PDF compression tool

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Only PDF files are allowed">
  Convert your document to PDF before uploading. Most applications (Word, Google Docs, etc.) can
  export to PDF format.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You cannot upload encrypted PDFs">
  The PDF is password-protected or encrypted. Open it in a PDF reader, remove the security settings,
  and save a new copy.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You have reached your document limit">
    Your plan has a monthly document limit. Options:

    - Wait until your limit resets next month
    - Upgrade to a higher plan
    - Delete unused draft documents (this does not restore quota)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upload fails with no error message">
    Check that:

    - Your internet connection is stable
    - The file is a valid PDF (try opening it in a PDF reader)
    - The file is not corrupted

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
