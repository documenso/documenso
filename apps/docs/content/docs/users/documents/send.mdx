## Prerequisites

Before sending, ensure your document has:

- At least one recipient added
- Signature fields assigned to each signer
- Required email addresses for recipients with authentication enabled

## Send a Document

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **Send Document** in the document editor.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Choose the distribution method: **Email** (recipients get signing links by email) or **None**
    (you get links to share manually).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If using email, configure subject, message, and reply-to as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Send** or **Generate Links** to send the document.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once sent, the document status changes from **Draft** to **Pending**.

## Email Customization

When sending via email, you can customize the email that recipients receive. There are 2 ways to customize the email.

You can customize it before sending the document, after pressing the **Send** button.

![Document email settings](/document-signing/documenso-document-email-settings.webp)

Or you can customize it before sending the document, by clicking on the **Document Settings** button in the editor sidebar. On this page, you can also customize what emails are sent to the recipients.

![Editor email settings](/document-signing/documenso-editor-email-settings.webp)

### Reply-to email (optional)

Set a reply-to address so recipient replies go to a specific email instead of the default.

### Subject (optional)

Customize the email subject line. If left blank, recipients see a default subject based on their role:

<Tabs items={['Signers', 'Approvers', 'Viewers']}>
  <Tab value="Signers">"Please sign this document"</Tab>
  <Tab value="Approvers">"Please approve this document"</Tab>
  <Tab value="Viewers">"Please view this document"</Tab>
</Tabs>

For team documents, the subject includes the team name.

### Message (optional)

Add a custom message that appears in the email body. You can use these variables:

- `{signer.name}` - Recipient's name
- `{signer.email}` - Recipient's email
- `{document.name}` - Document title

If left blank, a default message is generated based on the recipient's role and whether the sender is part of an organisation.

<Callout type="info">
  Enterprise organisations can configure custom sender email addresses from their organisation
  settings.
</Callout>

## What Recipients Receive

![Email recipient receives](/document-signing/documenso-sign-email.webp)

Each recipient receives an email containing:

- The document title
- Your name and email (or team name for organisation accounts)
- Your custom message (or a default message)
- A button to access the document

The email includes a unique signing link specific to that recipient. This link expires once the document is completed or deleted.

## Document Status After Sending

After sending, your document moves through these statuses:

| Status        | Meaning                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pending**   | Waiting for recipients to complete their actions |
| **Completed** | All recipients have completed their actions      |
| **Rejected**  | A recipient rejected the document                |

You can track progress from the document detail page, which shows each recipient's signing status.

## Resend to Recipients

If a recipient hasn't acted on the document, you can send them a reminder:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the document from your Documents page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the actions menu (three dots) and select **Resend**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Check the recipients you want to remind, then click **Send reminder**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Reminders are only available for:

- Documents with **Pending** status
- Recipients who haven't yet signed

The reminder email includes "Reminder:" prefixed to the subject line and uses the same message from the original send.

## Delete a Pending Document

To stop a signing process and remove a document:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open the document from your Documents page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the actions menu (three dots) and select **Delete**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Type "delete" to confirm, then click **Delete**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  Deleting a pending document is irreversible. The document is permanently deleted, all signatures
  are voided, and recipients receive a cancellation email.
</Callout>

### Delete Behavior by Status

| Status        | What happens                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**     | Permanently deleted, no notifications sent               |
| **Pending**   | Permanently deleted, recipients notified of cancellation |
| **Completed** | Hidden from your account, recipients keep their copies   |

## Document Settings

Access document settings from the **Document Settings** button in the quick actions sidebar of the editor.

### General Settings

| Setting                          | Description                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Security Settings

Control authentication requirements for accessing and signing the document.

**Document-level access control:**

| Option              | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Require account** | The recipient must have an account and be signed in to view the document |
| **Require 2FA**     | The recipient must use two-factor authentication                         |
| **None**            | The document can be accessed directly via the signing link               |

**Recipient Authentication** allows you to require additional verification when a recipient signs a signature field:

| Option              | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Require passkey** | The recipient must have a passkey configured |
| **Require 2FA**     | The recipient must have 2FA enabled          |
| **None**            | No additional authentication                 |

You can set authentication at the document level and override it per recipient.

<Callout type="info">
  Recipient Authentication is an Enterprise feature. See the [Enterprise
  Edition](/docs/policies/enterprise-edition) for details.
</Callout>

### Attachments

Configure document attachments from the right-hand side of the editor header. Attachments are included with the signed document when it is completed.

## Distribution Without Email

If you choose **None** as the distribution method:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Steps>
  <Step>
    The document is sent without notifying recipients.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    You're redirected to the document page where signing links are displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Copy the links and share them through your preferred channel (SMS, messaging app, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is useful when you want to:

- Send links via SMS or messaging apps
- Embed signing links in your own application
- Control the notification timing yourself
