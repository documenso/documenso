After adding recipients and placing fields on your document, you can send it for signing. This page covers the sending process, email customization, and post-send actions.

## Prerequisites

Before sending, ensure your document has:

- At least one recipient added
- Signature fields assigned to each signer
- Required email addresses for recipients with authentication enabled

## Send a document

1. Click **Send Document** in the document editor
2. Choose the distribution method:
   - **Email** - Recipients receive email notifications with signing links
   - **None** - No emails sent; you receive signing links to share manually
3. Configure email settings (if using email distribution)
4. Click **Send** or **Generate Links**

Once sent, the document status changes from **Draft** to **Pending**.

## Email customization

When sending via email, you can customize what recipients receive.

### Reply-to email (optional)

Set a reply-to address so recipient replies go to a specific email instead of the default.

### Subject (optional)

Customize the email subject line. If left blank, recipients see a default subject based on their role:

- Signers: "Please sign this document"
- Approvers: "Please approve this document"
- Viewers: "Please view this document"

For team documents, the subject includes the team name.

### Message (optional)

Add a custom message that appears in the email body. You can use these variables:

- `{signer.name}` - Recipient's name
- `{signer.email}` - Recipient's email
- `{document.name}` - Document title

If left blank, a default message is generated based on the recipient's role and whether the sender is part of an organization.

<Callout type="info">
  Enterprise organizations can configure custom sender email addresses from their organization
  settings.
</Callout>

## What recipients receive

![Email recipient receives](/document-signing/documenso-sign-email.webp)

Each recipient receives an email containing:

- The document title
- Your name and email (or team name for organization accounts)
- Your custom message (or a default message)
- A button to access the document

The email includes a unique signing link specific to that recipient. This link expires once the document is completed or deleted.

## Document status after sending

After sending, your document moves through these statuses:

| Status        | Meaning                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pending**   | Waiting for recipients to complete their actions |
| **Completed** | All recipients have completed their actions      |
| **Rejected**  | A recipient rejected the document                |

You can track progress from the document detail page, which shows each recipient's signing status.

## Resend to recipients

If a recipient hasn't acted on the document, you can send them a reminder:

1. Open the document from your Documents page
2. Click the actions menu (three dots)
3. Select **Resend**
4. Check the recipients you want to remind
5. Click **Send reminder**

Reminders are only available for:

- Documents with **Pending** status
- Recipients who haven't yet signed

The reminder email includes "Reminder:" prefixed to the subject line and uses the same message from the original send.

## Delete a pending document

To stop a signing process and remove a document:

1. Open the document
2. Click the actions menu (three dots)
3. Select **Delete**
4. Type "delete" to confirm
5. Click **Delete**

<Callout type="warn">
  Deleting a pending document is irreversible. The document is permanently deleted, all signatures
  are voided, and recipients receive a cancellation email.
</Callout>

### Delete behavior by status

| Status        | What happens                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**     | Permanently deleted, no notifications sent               |
| **Pending**   | Permanently deleted, recipients notified of cancellation |
| **Completed** | Hidden from your account, recipients keep their copies   |

## Distribution without email

If you choose **None** as the distribution method:

1. The document is sent without notifying recipients
2. You're redirected to the document page with signing links displayed
3. Copy the links and share them through your preferred channel

This is useful when you want to:

- Send links via SMS or messaging apps
- Embed signing links in your own application
- Control the notification timing yourself
