## Overview

Organisation groups lets you manage users across your organisation efficiently. Instead of assigning users to teams one by one, groups allow you to manage access at scale with consistent permissions.

## Key Benefits

<Tabs items={['Instant Access', 'Bulk Operations', 'Role Consistency', 'Audit Trail']}>
<Tab value="Instant Access">

New hires get immediate, appropriate access across all relevant teams.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Bulk Operations">

Remove an entire group (e.g. a departing contractor team) and all members lose access simultaneously.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Role Consistency">

The same role is applied consistently across teams. Avoid accidentally giving admin access when member access was intended.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Audit Trail">

Easily track which groups have access to which teams.
