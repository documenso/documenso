## Where Branding Appears

| Location                | Effect                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Signing pages**       | Recipients see your logo when viewing and signing documents  |
| **Email notifications** | Brand details appear at the bottom of signing request emails |

## Organisation vs Team Branding

Branding can be configured at two levels:

### Organisation branding

Set default branding for your entire organisation in **Organisation Settings > Preferences > Branding**. All teams inherit these settings by default.

### Team branding

Override organisation branding for specific teams in **Team Settings > Preferences > Branding**. Team settings support three options:

| Setting                       | Behavior                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yes**                       | Enable branding with team-specific logo and details              |
| **No**                        | Disable branding for this team (show default Documenso branding) |
| **Inherit from organisation** | Use the organisation's branding settings                         |

<Callout type="info">
  When a team has **Inherit from organisation** selected, any changes to organisation branding
  automatically apply to that team.
</Callout>

For individual branding fields (logo, URL, details), leaving them blank also inherits from the organisation.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Logo not appearing">
    - Verify custom branding is enabled (set to **Yes**)
    - Check that the image file is under 5MB
    - Ensure the file format is JPG, PNG, or WebP
    - Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Brand details not in emails">
    - Confirm the **Brand Details** field is filled in
    - Verify branding is enabled
    - Check that you saved changes by clicking **Update**

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
