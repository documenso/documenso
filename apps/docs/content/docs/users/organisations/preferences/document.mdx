## Overview

Document preferences allow you to set the default settings when creating new documents and templates.

For example, you can set the default language for documents sent by the team, or set the allowed signatures types.

## Preferences

Document preferences can be set on either the organisation or team level.

By default, teams inherit the preferences from the organisation. You can override these preferences on the team level at any time.

To access the preferences, navigate to either the organisation or teams settings page and click the **Document** tab under the **Preferences** section.

### Sender Details

If the **Sender Details** setting is enabled, the emails sent by the team will include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example User" on behalf of "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"

If the **Sender Details** setting is disabled, the emails sent by the team will not include the sender's name. The email will say:

> "Example Team" has invited you to sign "document.pdf"
