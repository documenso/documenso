### Billing and Subscription Management

Organisations handle billing centrally, making it easier to manage:

- **Unified Billing**: One subscription covers all teams in the organisation
- **Seat Management**: Add or remove seats across all teams automatically (Teams plan)

You can change plans, view invoices and manage your subscription from the billing page which is accessible from the organisation settings.
