# Compliance

Compliance in document signing involves meeting legal requirements for electronic signatures to be valid and enforceable. Different jurisdictions have different frameworks that define when an electronic signature carries the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.

Documenso provides features that support compliance with major e-signature laws, including audit trails, document integrity verification, and signer identification. The specific compliance requirements for your use case depend on your jurisdiction, industry, and the types of documents you process.
