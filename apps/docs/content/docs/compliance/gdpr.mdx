## Documenso's Role

When using Documenso for document signing, two distinct data processing roles apply:

| Role                | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Controller** | You (the organization using Documenso) determine the purposes and means of processing |
| **Data Processor**  | Documenso processes personal data on your behalf according to your instructions       |

As the data controller, you are responsible for:

- Obtaining appropriate consent or legal basis for processing
- Informing data subjects about how their data is used
- Responding to data subject access requests
- Ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements

As the data processor, Documenso:

- Processes data only according to your instructions
- Implements appropriate security measures
- Assists with data subject requests when needed
- Maintains records of processing activities

## Data Processing

Documenso processes personal data necessary to provide document signing services:

| Data Category      | Examples                                       | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Data**  | Name, email address                            | User accounts, recipient identification |
| **Document Data**  | Uploaded PDFs, field values                    | Document storage and signing            |
| **Signature Data** | Signature images, signing timestamps           | Recording signing actions               |
| **Audit Data**     | IP addresses, browser information, action logs | Audit trail and verification            |

Data is processed for the following purposes:

- Delivering documents to recipients
- Recording signatures and other recipient actions
- Generating signed documents with audit trails
- Sending email notifications

## Data Storage Locations

Where your data is stored depends on how you use Documenso:

### Documenso Cloud

For the hosted cloud service:

- Application data is stored in data centers within the European Union
- Document storage uses EU-based infrastructure
- Backups are maintained in geographically separate EU locations

Contact Documenso for specific information about sub-processors and data center locations.

### Self-Hosted

When you self-host Documenso:

- You control all data storage locations
- No data is transmitted to Documenso's infrastructure
- You choose your own database, file storage, and backup locations

Self-hosting provides complete control over data residency, which may be required for certain compliance scenarios.

## Data Subject Rights

GDPR grants individuals specific rights regarding their personal data. As the data controller, you are responsible for fulfilling these requests:

| Right             | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access**        | Data subjects can request a copy of their personal data                    |
| **Rectification** | Data subjects can request correction of inaccurate data                    |
| **Erasure**       | Data subjects can request deletion of their data ("right to be forgotten") |
| **Portability**   | Data subjects can request their data in a machine-readable format          |
| **Restriction**   | Data subjects can request limited processing of their data                 |
| **Objection**     | Data subjects can object to certain types of processing                    |

When you receive a data subject request, you can:

- Export user and document data from your Documenso account
- Delete user accounts and associated documents
- Contact Documenso support for assistance with cloud-hosted data

## Data Deletion

Documenso supports data deletion to help fulfill erasure requests:

**User Account Deletion**

- Users can delete their own accounts
- Account deletion removes profile data and authentication credentials
- Team owners can remove members from teams

**Document Deletion**

- Document owners can delete documents in draft state
- Completed documents can be deleted by the owner
- Deletion removes the document, recipient data, and associated audit logs

**Retention Considerations**

For signed documents, you may need to balance deletion requests against:

- Legal requirements to retain signed contracts
- Your organization's record-keeping policies
- The rights of other parties to the signed document

Consult with legal counsel to establish appropriate retention policies.

## Self-Hosting for GDPR Compliance

Self-hosting Documenso can simplify GDPR compliance:

- **Data residency** - Store all data in your chosen jurisdiction
- **Sub-processor control** - No third-party data processors beyond your own infrastructure
- **Direct access** - Full database access for data subject requests
- **Retention control** - Implement custom data retention and deletion policies

See the [Self-Hosting Guide](/docs/self-hosting) for deployment options.

## Data Processing Agreement

A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is a contract required by GDPR when a data controller engages a data processor.

For Documenso Cloud users:

- A DPA is available upon request
- Contact [support@documenso.com](mailto:support@documenso.com) to request a DPA
- The DPA covers Documenso's obligations as a data processor

For self-hosted deployments, no DPA with Documenso is required since no personal data is processed by Documenso.
