# Docker Setup for Documenso

The following guide will walk you through setting up Documenso using Docker. You can choose between a production setup using Docker Compose or a standalone container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (if using the Docker Compose setup)

## Option 1: Production Docker Compose Setup

This setup includes a PostgreSQL database and the Documenso application. You will need to provide your own SMTP details via environment variables.

1. Download the Docker Compose file from the Documenso repository: [compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/documenso/documenso/release/docker/production/compose.yml)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `compose.yml` file.
3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory and add your SMTP details as well as a few extra environment variables, following the example below:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-secret>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-key>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY="<your-secondary-key>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL="<your-url>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT="smtp-auth"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_HOST="<your-host>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PORT=<your-port>
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_USERNAME="<your-username>"
NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_PASSWORD="<your-password>"
```

4. Update the volume binding for the cert file in the `compose.yml` file to point to your own key file:

Since the `cert.p12` file is required for signing and encrypting documents, you will need to provide your own key file. Update the volume binding in the `compose.yml` file to point to your key file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/keyfile.p12:/opt/documenso/cert.p12
```

1. Run the following command to start the containers:

```
docker-compose --env-file ./.env up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database and the Documenso application containers.

5. Access the Documenso application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Option 2: Standalone Docker Container

If you prefer to host the Documenso application on your container provider of choice, you can use the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub or GitHub's Package Registry. Note that you will need to provide your own database and SMTP host.

1. Pull the Documenso Docker image:

```
docker pull documenso/documenso
```

Or, if using GitHub's Package Registry:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/documenso/documenso
```

2. Run the Docker container, providing the necessary environment variables for your database and SMTP host:

```
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL="<your-nextauth-url>"
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your-nextauth-secret>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="<your-next-private-encryption-key>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_ENCRYPTION_SECONDARY_KEY="<your-next-private-encryption-secondary-key>"
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL="<your-next-public-webapp-url>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_INTERNAL_WEBAPP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL="<your-next-private-database-url>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="<your-next-private-database-url>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_TRANSPORT="<your-next-private-smtp-transport>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_NAME="<your-next-private-smtp-from-name>"
  -e NEXT_PRIVATE_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS="<your-next-private-smtp-from-address>"
  -v /path/to/your/keyfile.p12:/opt/documenso/cert.p12
  documenso/documenso
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual database and SMTP details.

1. Access the Documenso application by visiting the URL you provided in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` environment variable in your web browser.

## Success

You have now successfully set up Documenso using Docker. You can start organizing and managing your documents efficiently. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please refer to the official Documenso documentation or seek assistance from the community.
